While virtual reality (VR) and music therapy independently show promise in pain management, the neural oscillatory underpinnings of rhythm-synchronized audiomotor integration in VR therapy remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate whether music-synchronized virtual reality (MSVR) enhances analgesia through distinct neural mechanisms compared to conventional distraction-based VR or non-immersive interventions. 90 healthy adults (45 female, 22&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2 years) were randomized to a single session of: (1) MSVR (rhythm-synchronized visuomotor tasks with music), (2) conventional VR (identical tasks with white noise), or (3) non-immersive 2D control. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were measured at five movement-generating muscle sites. Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) efficiency was assessed using PPT and cold-water stimulation. 64-channel EEG recorded theta, alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations. Outcomes included PPT changes, CPM efficiency, cold pain intensity/unpleasantness, and neural spectral power. MSVR significantly increased PPTs across all sites (15-25% vs. control, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; superior to VR in upper limbs, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) and enhanced CPM efficiency by 18% (vs. control, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.010; vs. VR, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046). Cold pain intensity decreased by 22% with MSVR (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05 vs. both groups). MSVR uniquely enhanced parietal alpha oscillations during and post-intervention (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). MSVR also induced greater immersion and realism than VR (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). MSVR significantly enhances endogenous pain inhibition and elevates pain thresholds more effectively than conventional VR or 2D interventions, primarily through rhythmic audiomotor integration modulating parietal alpha-oscillation modulation. These findings suggest MSVR as a scalable digital therapeutic strategy for pain management.",D006801; D005260; D008297; D055815; D000328; D017288; D000076142; D059408; D009147; D004569; D063367; D009146; D059350,Humans; Female; Male; Young Adult; Adult; Pain Threshold; Virtual Reality; Pain Management; Music Therapy; Electroencephalography; Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy; Music; Chronic Pain,82372578; 2024YFC3607600; 2024R2003; 202502AS100005,NA,Declarations.

While cognitive stimulation (CS) is supported in other neurodegenerative conditions, its role in PD is less explored. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of a therapist-guided, home-based CS program, delivered via a virtual reality rehabilitation system, with a conventional in-person CS intervention. Of 123 individuals screened, 45 patients with PD and mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) were randomized to either the tele-rehabilitation group (TRG; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;25) or the control group (CG; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20). Both groups received the same standardized 4-week CS program (20 multi-domain sessions, 5&#xa0;days/week), targeting memory, attention, executive functions, language, and visuospatial skills. The TRG trained at home via the VRRS platform under remote supervision, while the CG attended outpatient sessions. Neuropsychological and clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and 6-month follow-up (T3). Analyses included repeated-measures ANOVA, multivariate linear regression, and categorical comparisons based on predefined clinical cut-offs. All participants completed the intervention with adherence exceeding 90% in both groups. At T2, the TRG showed greater improvements than the CG in global cognition, working memory, and delayed recall. These effects remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, baseline performance, and cognitive reserve index, and were robust to false discovery rate correction. Regression models confirmed these improvements. Categorical analyses also showed a marked reduction in pathological scores in the TRG in the same domains. A short-term, therapist-guided CS program delivered via tele-rehabilitation effectively improved cognitive functioning in PD-MCI, with partial benefits maintained at 6 months, especially in memory and executive domains. The intervention was particularly beneficial for memory and executive functions, highlighting telemedicine as a promising and accessible option for cognitive care in PD.",D006801; D008297; D010300; D060825; D005260; D000368; D008875; D005500; D000069350; D009483,Humans; Male; Parkinson Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Aged; Middle Aged; Follow-Up Studies; Telerehabilitation; Neuropsychological Tests,NET-2016-02361805,NA,"Declarations.

Numerous techniques for teaching cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are being used, yet there is insufficient data on the effectiveness of using virtual reality (VR). The aim of the study was to evaluate the short- and three-month didactic effect in teaching BLS procedures and chest compressions using modern virtual reality (VR) technology. A total of 205 subjects were included in the study, assigned by randomized controlled design to a study group (A) implementing VR training and a control group (B) participating in traditional training. The participant group consisted of 73.91% women and 26.09% men, with a mean age of 21.80&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.46 years. The process was divided into two stages, which assessed the level of knowledge and skills immediately after the specific type of training, as well as three months later. Practical skills were assessed in detail according to a checklist. The authors conducted a series of statistical analyses to compare the groups and indicate relationships. A significance level of &#x3b1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05 was assumed for all analyses. The mean score of the overall quality of resuscitation immediately after the training in case of VR course participants was M&#x2009;=&#x2009;45.61% (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;34.13), while that of the traditional course participants was M&#x2009;=&#x2009;67.0% (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;32.56), with p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001. The level of knowledge obtained was found to be comparable (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.269). High satisfaction levels were identified by participants in both groups. The three-month evaluation (three months after the training) showed no significant intergroup differences (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.218). The mean quality of resuscitation was M&#x2009;=&#x2009;60.32% for the traditional group and 54.32% for the VR group. In the long term, it is noteworthy that there was a significant decrease in the quality of chest compressions after traditional training (by 6.68 p.p.), wherein this parameter increased among VR course participants (by 8.67 p.p.). Teaching methods involving virtual reality to train CPR gain three-month effectiveness that is comparable to traditional training, despite the lack of this conclusion confirmed in short-term evaluation. Modern VR technologies make it possible to achieve optimal first aid teaching results, minimizing the participation of instructors, and ensure perfect repetition of procedures, which is applicable to teaching large groups with a high level of satisfaction.

This study aims to explore the usage of digital therapy enhanced with virtual reality technology in the improvement of mood, pain level, and quality of life in patients experiencing moderate to severe pain. <b>Methods</b> In this prospective, single-centre clinical study, 100 herpes zoster patients experiencing moderate to severe neuropathic pain from November 2024 to January 2025 were enrolled. In addition to the application of 5% lidocaine topical patch combined with Pre-Bahrain system medication, the patients received a 14-day virtual reality (VR) treatment, encompassing evaluations at several time points: the first day (T0), the third day (T1), the seventh day (T2), and the 14th day (T3). <b>Results</b> The results of emotion and pain in all PHN patients evaluated at four time points showed that the self-reported scores of generalised anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7), numerical rating scale (NRS), and visual analogue scale (VAS) were improved during the 14-day treatment period (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Outcomes in sleep, stress and mood disturbance scale, based on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-A) and PROMIS-B, showed that the patients' sleep status, stress levels and emotional problems achieved improvements.

These pathologies are related to frequent hospitalizations and consequently high levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. In this respect, immersive virtual reality (IVR) relaxation integrated with savoring, which is the ability to generate and amplify positive emotions, can enhance well-being and relaxation in patients with CRDs. This pilot randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a 2-week IVR-based relaxation intervention integrated with savoring in patients with CRDs for increasing emotional and psychological well-being, positive emotions, relaxation, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), and decreasing negative emotions. This study included 45 hospitalized patients with CRDs from the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Unit of Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Istituto Nazionale di Ricovero e Cura per Anziani (INRCA) Casatenovo. Alongside traditional pulmonary rehabilitation, the experimental group (n=23) took part in a 4-session IVR-based intervention, while the active control group (n=22) listened to relaxing music. In each session, the experimental group experienced a relaxing virtual scenario followed by a savoring exercise. Both groups completed self-reported questionnaires at 3 time points-preintervention/baseline (T0), postintervention (T1), and 1-month follow-up (T2)-as well as before and after each session. The experimental group's IVR acceptance and sense of presence were also measured. Regarding the primary outcomes, taking T0 and T1 into account, repeated measures analysis of covariance revealed significant increases for the experimental group in emotional well-being (P&lt;.001; partial &#x3b7;&#xb2;=0.398), psychological well-being (P&lt;.001; partial &#x3b7;&#xb2;=0.559), positive emotions (P&lt;.001; partial &#x3b7;&#xb2;=0.407), and relaxation (P&lt;.001; partial &#x3b7;&#xb2;=0.598), and a significant decrease in negative emotions (P&lt;.001; partial &#x3b7;&#xb2;=0.456) compared to the control group. Moreover, 2-tailed paired t tests, considering T0 and T2, revealed significant long-term psychological changes at T2 for the experimental group in emotional well-being (P=.046), psychological well-being (P=.03), and positive emotions (P=.005), whereas the control group reported no significant changes. Concerning secondary outcomes, no significant differences in SpO2 between the 2 groups were found, and patients in the experimental group reported high IVR acceptance and sense of presence. These results suggest that relaxing IVR integrated with savoring may promote well-being not only after the intervention but also in the long term. Savoring may have played a role in enhancing the positive effects of the IVR experience by helping patients focus on and amplify positive experiences, thereby mitigating the negative psychological impact of CRDs. However, the study design (control group was exposed only to relaxing music without a savoring component) precludes the ability to determine the specific contribution of each element (IVR and savoring). Future research should aim to disentangle these components in order to clarify their individual and combined effects.",D006801; D010865; D008297; D000076142; D005260; D008875; D002908; D000368; D012064; D000328; D004644,Humans; Pilot Projects; Male; Virtual Reality; Female; Middle Aged; Chronic Disease; Aged; Relaxation Therapy; Adult; Emotions,NA,10.1016/j.ijid.2014.12.016; 10.1002/14651858.CD013040.pub2; 10.1016/j.dsx.2021.04.007; 10.1016/j.eclinm.2023.101936; 10.1183/09031936.00138606; 10.1183/09031936.04.00014304; 10.3390/jcm10020352; 10.1080/0963828031000122311; 10.1164/rccm.201309-1634ST; 10.1002/14651858.CD003793.pub3; 10.1159/000112889; 10.1080/17476348.2020.1776118; 10.1371/journal.pone.0184300; 10.3390/jpm13091310; 10.1177/089801019901700302; 10.3233/THC-130773; 10.4187/respcare.07489; 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053189; 10.1017/S003329171700040X; 10.1037/1072-5245.14.3.260; 10.1111/bjet.13030; 10.1097/HRP.0000000000000138; 10.1089/cyber.2022.29265.ceu; 10.3390/jcm7030042; 10.3390/ijerph18158188; 10.1016/j.psychres.2016.01.015; 10.1089/cyber.2014.0052; 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00479; 10.1007/s00127-021-02110-z; 10.1089/cyber.2022.0246; 10.2196/17233; 10.1038/s41598-022-16270-8; 10.2196/14178; 10.3390/jcm10061261; 10.2196/47114; 10.1016/B978-0-12-407236-7.00001-2; 10.1111/1467-9280.00431; 10.1037/0022-3514.86.2.320; 10.4324/9781315088426; 10.1037/emo0000914; 10.1080/13607863.2014.986647; 10.3389/fpsyg.2021.771698; 10.1186/s40359-023-01225-z; 10.1136/bmj.39339.610000.BE; 10.3352/jeehp.2021.18.17; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.44030; 10.1001/archpsyc.1983.01790060110016; 10.1080/87565649109540545; 10.1111/j.1468-1331.1996.tb00423.x; 10.1017/S1121189X00006898; 10.1111/j.1600-0404.1995.tb01029.x; 10.1002/0470846410.ch27(ii); 10.1007/s11205-010-9632-5; 10.2307/3090197; 10.1007/s11205-014-0629-3; 10.1007/s11205-009-9493-y; 10.1708/2304.24796; 10.1177/003591576906201005; 10.1162/105474600566989; 10.1016/j.invent.2021.100459; 10.1093/jmt/38.4.254; 10.3389/fpsyt.2020.563319; 10.1186/s13063-022-06337-2; 10.3390/jcm12052006; 10.1002/oti.203; 10.2147/COPD.S113108; 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; 10.1136/spcare-2023-004502; 10.1016/j.chb.2021.107008; 10.1177/0733464817693375; 10.3390/jcm9020500; 10.1080/13607863.2018.1471585; 10.1002/9781118315927.ch3; 10.1016/j.paid.2010.03.048; 10.1177/0733464819871876; 10.1080/08039480310000824; 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2005.04.007; 10.2147/COPD.S296696; 10.1177/1479972309346754; 10.1097/HNP.0000000000000235; 10.1136/hrt.2005.064600; 10.3389/fpsyt.2021.614539; 10.3390/healthcare9121729; 10.15294/harmonia.v22i1.36232; 10.1038/s41598-019-41200-6; 10.1186/s12877-019-1218-8; 10.1186/s12245-023-00545-6; 10.1007/s00426-020-01417-x,"<b>Conflicts of Interest:</b> LB is affiliated with Become-Hub, the company that developed the virtual reality scenarios used in this study.

This study explores an interactive VR-Motion serious game designed for children with ASD, leveraging immersive, controlled environments to enhance social skills, self-care, and emotional regulation. Children with autism often suffer from multiple complications; thus, new serious games that are versatile and easy to use are more suitable for them. This study aims to design and develop a versatile serious game for multifaceted intervention in children with autism, encompassing psychological, social, and learning aspects. We also aim to evaluate the rationality of its design and the effectiveness of its content, with the ultimate goal of providing an effective intervention therapy for children with autism.

A previous study on mice demonstrated that the persistent attenuation of remote fear memories can be achieved by combining histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) with fear-memory retrieval prior to extinction training. To evaluate the translational potential of this approach, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Forty-eight individuals with DSM-IV spider phobia received either HDACi valproic acid (VPA, 500&#xa0;mg) or a placebo prior to the retrieval of fear memory, followed by exposure therapy in virtual reality. No significant group difference was found in terms of behavioral change on the behavioral approach test at 3&#xa0;months follow-up and baseline (primary outcome). However, the VPA group displayed significantly reduced fear in two self-report questionnaires related to spider phobia (Fear of Spiders Questionnaire; Spider Phobia Beliefs Questionnaire) as compared to the placebo group. No group differences were observed for psychophysiological indicators of fear. The favorable impact of a single administration of VPA in combination with fear-memory retrieval prior to exposure therapy suggests that it might be an effective way to enhance symptom improvement at the subjective level in the treatment of phobias. Further studies need to investigate the conditions under which an improvement on the psychophysiological and behavioral levels can be achieved as well.",D006801; D014635; D010698; D005260; D000328; D007171; D005239; D008297; D004311; D056572; D013112; D011939; D055815; D000818; D003131; D008875,Humans; Valproic Acid; Phobic Disorders; Female; Adult; Implosive Therapy; Fear; Male; Double-Blind Method; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Spiders; Mental Recall; Young Adult; Animals; Combined Modality Therapy; Middle Aged,NA,NA,NA,"Nathalie Schicktanz, Frieder Dechent, Carlo Andreas Huber, Anja Zimmer, Galya Clara Iseli, Jeanne Howald, Maya Thalia Schenker, Johannes Gr&#xe4;ff, Undine Lang,  ..., Doroth&#xe9;e Bentz","Division of Cognitive Neuroscience, https://ror.org/02s6k3f65University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.",TRUE,TRUE

Various distraction methods, such as virtual reality (VR), have been shown to reduce anxiety levels and improve surgical outcomes. This study aimed to determine the effect of watching cartoons through a VR headset before surgery on systolic blood pressure, postoperative pain, and anxiety levels as primary, secondary, and tertiary outcomes, respectively, in children aged 7-12 years undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. This randomized controlled experimental study was conducted at a tertiary hospital between November 10, 2023, and June 1, 2024, among 102 children scheduled for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, who were randomly divided into an experimental group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;51; VR intervention) and a control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;51; no intervention). The primary outcomes were anxiety levels measured using the Perioperative Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children and postoperative pain evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale. Sociodemographic characteristics and vital signs were also assessed. Systolic blood pressure values were significantly lower in the experimental group at than in the control group at all time points (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).

A 2-arm, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial compared virtual reality with standard care. Children aged 4 to 14&#xa0;years requiring an elective PIVC were randomly assigned (1:1) to virtual reality with a relaxing ocean film (intervention group) or standard care (control group). The outcomes measured were pain perception (Faces Pain Scale-Revised) and procedure-related distress (Observational Behavioral Distress Scale). A total of 352 children were stratified by age (4-8 and 9-14&#xa0;years) before randomization into intervention (48.6%, n =&#xa0;171) and control (51.4%, n =&#xa0;181) groups. The pain was significantly reduced for children receiving virtual reality across all age groups (relative risk [RR]: 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45-0.72). This reduction was observed in younger (RR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.39-0.71) and older children (RR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.43-0.91).

In addition, current BCIs are mostly in single-task mode. The BCI system used in this study was based on a dual-task model of motor imagery (MI) and virtual reality (VR). Previous studies have demonstrated that dual-task seems to be beneficial for balance and attention. The purpose of this study was to validate the effects of MI-VR-based dual-task BCI on balance and attention in participants with stroke. This pilot, single-blind, randomized controlled trial involved 38 stroke participants, randomized to the BCI (BCI pedaling training) or control group (conventional pedaling). Both groups trained 20&#xa0;min daily, 5&#xa0;days a week for 4&#xa0;weeks, alongside conventional rehabilitation. Thirty participants completed the program (mean age: 56.56&#xa0;years, mean disease duration: 4.48&#xa0;months). Assessments were made before and after 4&#xa0;weeks. The primary outcome was the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and secondary outcomes included the Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT), Fugl-Meyer Lower Extremity Assessment (FMA-LE), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), and average attention index. 30 participants completed the study (14 in the BCI and 16 in the control group). The retention rates were 73.68% and 84.21% respectively. No adverse events were reported in this study and participants did not report any discomfort. The changes in BBS, TUGT and SDMT values in the BCI group were significantly better than those in the control group (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Average attention index of the BCI group's participants grew with the number of training sessions, and there was a significant difference comparing pre- to post-treatment (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). The value of BBS change is linearly correlated with the value of SDMT change (F&#x2009;=&#x2009;8.778, y&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.59x&#x2009;+&#x2009;1.90, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). This study initially showed positive effects of dual-task mode of BCI pedalling training on balance and attention in stroke participants.

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of BCI-based rehabilitation in improving motor function through multimodal assessment, and to explore the potential neuroplastic changes resulting from this intervention. We conducted a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial with multimodal assessment to evaluate the efficacy of a BCI system for enhancing motor recovery. A total of 48 ischemic stroke patients completed the study (25 BCI, 23 control). The BCI group used an 8-electrode electroencephalogram (EEG) system, a virtual reality training module, and a rehabilitation training robot for real-time motor intention-based feedback. The control group used identical BCI devices but without displaying real-time data and feedback. Participants underwent 20-minute upper and lower limb training sessions for two weeks. Motor function (Fugl-Meyer Extremity scale), electromyography (EMG), and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) were assessed pre- and post-intervention. The BCI group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in upper extremity motor function compared to the control group (&#x394;FMA-UE: 4.0 vs. 2.0, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046). EEG results of the BCI group showed a significant decrease in both DAR (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.031) and DABR (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) compared to baseline. EMG analysis revealed that BCI treatment resulted in significant increases in deltoid and bicipital muscle activity during both shoulder and elbow flexion movements compared to baseline (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). fNIRS results indicated enhanced functional connectivity and activation in key motor-related brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, and primary motor cortex in the BCI group. BCI-based rehabilitation using an attention-motor dual-task paradigm significantly improved upper limb motor function and enhanced motor and cognitive network activity in stroke patients.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality (VR)-based cue exposure therapy (CET) and cue exposure with aversion therapy (CETA) in reducing methamphetamine craving in men with MUD. In this randomized controlled trial, 89 men with MUD were assigned to three groups: VR-based cue exposure therapy (CET, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30), VR-based cue exposure combined with aversion therapy (CETA, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;29), and neutral scenes (NS, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30). The intervention comprised 16 sessions over 8 weeks. Primary outcomes were tonic craving and cue-induced craving. Secondary outcomes included attentional bias, rehabilitation confidence, drug refusal self-efficacy, anxiety, and depression. Both CET and CETA groups demonstrated significant reductions in tonic craving post-intervention (CET: p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001; CETA: p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.010), while the NS group showed no change (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.217). The CET group demonstrated significantly lower post-intervention tonic craving compared to the NS group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.047). All groups showed decreased cue-induced craving in drug use scenes (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). The CETA group showed significantly improved drug refusal self-efficacy compared to baseline (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) and the NS group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018). The CET group demonstrated reduced anxiety compared to the NS group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014). No serious adverse events were reported during VR exposure. VR-based cue exposure therapy, particularly when combined with aversion therapy, effectively reduces psychological craving and improves drug refusal self-efficacy in MUD patients. This study provides evidence supporting VR-based interventions as a safe and promising tool for MUD treatment, though larger-scale trials are needed to confirm long-term efficacy.

An open-label, two-armed, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Sixty-six elderly individuals with MCI will be recruited and randomly allocated to either the IVR-CST or the conventional CST group. Their cognition will be measured before and immediately after therapy and 4 weeks post-therapy. A 14-session IVR-CST or conventional CST, with content adapted from the Chinese-translated manual of CST, will be carried out twice per week in groups of three to four individuals. The Hong Kong Montreal Cognitive Assessment and measures on executive functions/working memory will serve as primary outcomes. The within-subject (before and after therapy) and between-subject (IVR-CST vs. conventional CST) differences will be examined. Besides, eye movements during therapy in the IVR-CST group will be collected and its correlation with primary outcomes will be studied. Positive changes in cognition are expected after therapy in both treatment groups, which may be maintained four weeks post-therapy.

However, this can lead to increased adverse effects from additional drugs. Immersive virtual reality (iVR) reduces pain and anxiety. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of iVR in managing side effects associated with TC or TC+Bev therapy. This 2-arm randomized controlled trial included patients with gynecologic cancer scheduled to undergo their first course of TC/TC+Bev. Patients in the intervention group received iVR for approximately 10 minutes/day for 7 consecutive days, starting on the first day of treatment. The primary endpoint was the severity of physical and psychiatric symptoms measured using the Japanese version of the revised Edmonton Symptom Rating System (ESAS-r-J). The secondary endpoint included the proportion of patients who used additional antiemetic medications, the complete response (CR) rate to nausea, and the severity of anxiety, measured using the state-trait anxiety inventory-JYZ (STAI) Y-1. Patients in the nonintervention group received supportive and symptomatic treatments. The analysis included 28 and 30 patients in the intervention and nonintervention groups, respectively. The change in ESAS-r-J scores between days 1 and 7 and nausea were significantly worse in the intervention group on day 4 only (P&lt;.001); however, the nonintervention group showed significantly worse scores on days 3, 4, and 5. Depression was not significantly worse in the intervention group on any day other than on day 1; however, the nonintervention group showed significantly worse scores on day 4.

While most cases resolve spontaneously, prolonged dysfunction imposes significant physical, psychological, and socioeconomic burdens. Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a promising adjunct in neurorehabilitation, offering immersive environments that promote engagement and motor learning. However, its application in postoperative C5 palsy rehabilitation remains underexplored. This single-center randomized controlled trial was conducted from January to December 2023 at a tertiary academic hospital. Adult patients (&#x2265;&#x2009;20 years) who developed new-onset C5 palsy after posterior cervical fusion were enrolled. C5 palsy was defined as a&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;2-grade drop in shoulder flexion or abduction strength postoperatively. Patients were randomly assigned to either a control group that received standard postoperative rehabilitation or a VR-assisted group that received the same standard rehabilitation plus an additional VR-based rehabilitation program. VR rehabilitation included interactive, game-based shoulder exercises delivered via head-mounted displays during initial hospitalization and follow-ups at 3, 6, 12, and 24 weeks. Primary outcomes were surface electromyography-derived maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), %MVIC, and fatigue index (FI) of the deltoid muscles. Secondary outcomes included the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, Neck Disability Index (NDI), EuroQoL-5 Dimension (EQ-5D), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Data were collected preoperatively and at each postoperative visit. Ten patients (VR&#x2009;=&#x2009;4, Control&#x2009;=&#x2009;6) completed the study. Final analysis included data from 4 patients in the VR group and 6 patients in the control group. The VR group demonstrated significantly greater efficiency in muscle activation, evidenced by lower %MVIC values at 24 weeks during both shoulder flexion (median 1.0 vs. 1.5; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.025) and abduction (0.9 vs. 1.8; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014). Improvements in patient-reported quality of life (EQ-5D, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.032) and arm pain reduction (VAS, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.048) were observed. Depression scores (HADS-D) and anxiety scores (HADS-A) also trended lower in the VR group, particularly at 24 weeks (HADS-D: 4.0 vs. 9.5; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.067). Functional metrics, including maximum arm elevation (from 90.0&#xa0;cm to 145.0&#xa0;cm) and apple placement count (from 25 to 55 per session), improved markedly in the VR group. VR-assisted rehabilitation may contribute to improved neuromuscular efficiency, pain reduction, and psychological well-being in patients with postoperative C5 palsy. These preliminary findings suggest that immersive VR could be a promising adjunct in postoperative spinal rehabilitation, warranting further investigation in larger studies.

The study aimed to explore factors associated with distress over time in women diagnosed with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy (RT) with access to a digital information tool, specifically examining if factors such as health literacy and self-efficacy had any influence on distress. In this pilot randomised controlled trial, women were assigned to an intervention group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;59) with access to a digital information tool or a control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;52). Assessments were conducted at baseline, one week before RT (FU1), one week post- (FU2), and six months after treatment (FU3). Distress was measured at all time points, and associated factors were evaluated at baseline and six months. In the intervention group, a statistically significant reduction in distress was observed over time (FU1, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.009; FU2, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001; FU3, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001).

Additionally, we investigated whether the effectiveness of these interventions would vary based on trait anxiety levels. A total of 60 college students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: cognitive restructuring, mindfulness-based meditation, or control. Results revealed that StressMeta effectively induced stress but did not significantly increase anxiety. Contrary to expectations, neither cognitive restructuring nor mindfulness-based meditation significantly reduced stress or anxiety compared to the control condition. However, trait anxiety moderated the effects of the interventions. Individuals with high trait anxiety showed greater reductions in stress and anxiety following cognitive restructuring and mindfulness-based meditation compared to those with low trait anxiety. These findings suggest that cognitive and mindfulness-based interventions may be particularly beneficial for individuals with high trait anxiety, while their effectiveness for those with low trait anxiety may be limited.

However, third-wave therapeutic techniques such as cognitive defusion can be abstract, challenging to learn, and difficult to apply in real-world settings. Translating these techniques into virtual reality (VR) may provide interactive, enjoyable, and concrete learning opportunities, potentially enhancing engagement and effectiveness. This study evaluated a novel VR application that translates the technique of cognitive defusion into a brief, gamified VR experience. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and safety of the VR cognitive defusion application; examine whether it could improve negative thinking and mood states; and understand how it compared to a non-VR cognitive defusion exercise. In a mixed methods experimental study, 20 young people completed both a VR and audio cognitive defusion exercise in a randomized order within a single session. Quantitative state-based measures were taken before and after each exercise, and a qualitative interview at the end focused on how the two experiences compared. It was feasible to recruit participants, and all participants completed both exercises and assessments. Both the VR and audio exercises were acceptable to participants, with qualitative themes highlighting a preference for VR due to the novel and engaging format; however, there was a need for better guidance and more personalized environments. No severe adverse events were reported, although one participant experienced distress during the VR exercise. Pretest-posttest effects showed improvements in thought discomfort, cognitive defusion, and state anger for both the VR and audio conditions (P&lt;.05), with the latter showing broader improvements, including thought negativity, rumination, tension, depression, distress, and confusion (P&lt;.05). The VR cognitive defusion application was feasible, safe, and acceptable for young people, with potential to enhance mental health treatment through an engaging and enjoyable approach to learning third-wave cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. While VR was preferred by participants, further refinements could improve effectiveness. Future research should focus on enhancing the VR application design based on user feedback, incorporating audio guidance, and conducting a larger trial in real-world settings to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of the VR application.",D006801; D005260; D008297; D000293; D000076142; D015928; D003863; D001007; D005240; D055815,Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Virtual Reality; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Depression; Anxiety; Feasibility Studies; Young Adult,NA,10.31887/dcns.2020.22.2/lvalmaggia; 10.1038/S44159-024-00334-9; 10.1002/wps.20883; 10.1016/j.ctim.2020.102480; 10.1111/jcpp.13400; 10.1007/s40211-020-00349-7; 10.1001/archpsyc.62.6.593; 10.1111/jcpp.12381; 10.1136/ebmental-2018-300060; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.2482; 10.1016/j.cpr.2013.04.005; 10.1176/appi.ps.201900491; 10.1037/a0040360; 10.2196/30716; 10.1007/S41811-020-00090-7; 10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30053-1; 10.1002/wps.20884; 10.1177/0145445515621488; 10.1016/j.brat.2005.06.006; 10.1177/0145445510379632; 10.1038/s41398-021-01397-5; 10.1177/1745691615594577; 10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.01.007; 10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.09.009; 10.1016/j.brat.2014.07.018; 10.1016/j.jcbs.2015.01.002; 10.2196/jmir.6588; 10.1007/S10055-018-0372-1; 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00055; 10.2196/16106; 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02172; 10.1017/s1754470x23000053; 10.1111/j..2002.384.doc.x; 10.1016/j.jad.2008.06.026; 10.1001/archinte.166.10.1092; 10.1111/bjc.12052; 10.1007/bf03395641; 10.1016/j.brat.2003.10.008; 10.1162/105474601300343612; 10.1016/j.jad.2023.09.013; 10.1016/j.janxdis.2011.12.003; 10.1002/jclp.20326; 10.1016/j.jcbs.2018.04.002; 10.1080/026404199365425; 10.1016/S1469-0292(01)00035-8; 10.1017/S1352465810000287; 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; 10.1037/tra0000959; 10.1007/s12671-020-01589-y; 10.1007/S12671-021-01783-6; 10.1007/S10055-023-00926-5; 10.1016/S2215-0366(15)00565-9; 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.792663; 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00176; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.3838; 10.1097/MLR.0b013e3182408812,Conflicts of Interest: None declared.,"Imogen H Bell, Cassandra Li, Andrew Thompson, Carli Ellinghaus, Shaunagh O'Sullivan, Kate Alexandra Reynolds, Greg Wadley, Yang Liu, Sarah Bendall,  ..., Mario Alvarez-Jimenez","Orygen, Parkville, Australia.",TRUE,TRUE

Randomized controlled trial with a pre-test/post-test control group design. Study was conducted with 144&#x202f;s-year nursing students at an accredited state university in Turkey. Participants were randomly assigned to either a VR group or a traditional simulation group. Both groups received theoretical instruction in CPR followed by VR-based training using Oculus Quest 2 headsets or a traditional simulation-based exercise. Data were collected using the CPR Knowledge Test, the Self-Directed Learning Skills Scale, the Kolb Learning Style Inventory, the Simulation Design Scale and an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) for CPR skills. Both groups showed significant improvements in CPR skills after the intervention, with no significant difference between groups. The traditional simulation group showed a significant increase in self-directed learning skills, while no significant change was observed in the VR group. The VR group showed a supportive effect on abstract conceptualization in learning styles, but had no significant effect on learning preferences. Students in the VR group outperformed the control group on several critical psychomotor CPR skills measured by OSCE. Both groups rated their simulation experiences favorably.

A limited number of recent studies have found promising results when examining the use of VRE in the treatment of contamination-related obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of VRE with in&#xa0;vivo and imaginal exposure in reducing contamination-related OCD symptoms. Forty-four participants diagnosed with DSM-5 OCD and whose primary symptoms were contamination obsessions and cleaning compulsions were included in the study. Participants were matched based on their Y-BOCS scores and assigned to VRE (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7), in&#xa0;vivo exposure (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8), imaginal exposure (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8) and wait-list control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;10) groups. Participants in the exposure groups completed an average of 10 exposure sessions with two sessions per week. The results indicated that VRE reduced the severity of OCD symptoms and contamination-related cognitions, as well as improving psychological well-being. Additionally, the findings suggest that VRE may be as effective as in&#xa0;vivo and imaginal exposure in reducing OCD symptoms, particularly in diminishing contamination-related anxiety and compulsive behaviours.

This study evaluated the effects of non-immersive virtual reality (NIVR) combined with conventional physical therapy (CPT) on pain intensity, mechanical hyperalgesia, and perceived recovery in older adults with OA. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: Sixty older adults with mild-to-moderate knee or hip OA were randomly assigned to a NIVR group (NIVR-G; <i>n</i> = 30) or a CPT group (CPT-G; <i>n</i> = 30). Both groups completed 30 sessions over 10 weeks (3 sessions/week). The NIVR-G performed 20 minutes of exergames integrated into CPT. Pain intensity was assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and mechanical hyperalgesia was evaluated through pressure pain thresholds (PPTs). Secondary outcomes included the Global Rating of Change (GRoC) and the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the VAS. This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT05839262). <i>Results</i>: The NIVR-G demonstrated significant reductions in pain intensity after 30 sessions (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, <i>d</i> = 1.50), with greater improvements compared to the CPT-G (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, <i>d</i> = 1.17). The MCID for the VAS was established at 9.2 mm, with a higher proportion of responders in the NIVR-G (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The NIVR-G also reported superior recovery perception on the GRoC scale (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). No significant changes in PPTs were observed in either group. However, the improvements in the NIVR-G diminished four weeks post-intervention. <i>Conclusions</i>: NIVR exergames combined with CPT significantly reduced pain intensity, improved perceived recovery, and resulted in a higher proportion of responders compared to CPT alone. These findings support the use of NIVR as an effective adjunct to CPT in older adults with OA; however, further research is needed to optimize its long-term benefits.",D006801; D008297; D005260; D000368; D015207; D020370; D010147; D057566; D008875; D006930; D059408; D063367; D000076142; D005081,"Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Osteoarthritis, Hip; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Pain Measurement; Self Report; Middle Aged; Hyperalgesia; Pain Management; Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy; Virtual Reality; Exercise Therapy",SA22I0092.,10.1001/jama.2020.22171; 10.1136/bmj.m791; 10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-204763; 10.1016/j.cger.2010.03.001; 10.5435/JAAOS-22-04-261; 10.3390/ijerph192416815; 10.1016/j.joca.2007.12.017; 10.1186/s12891-019-2740-8; 10.1007/s10067-015-3087-7; 10.1002/art.34646; 10.1155/2022/4323045; 10.1371/journal.pone.0147526; 10.1016/j.joca.2021.03.021; 10.1016/j.joca.2015.02.163; 10.1016/j.pain.2010.09.030; 10.1002/art.24120; 10.1016/j.pain.2010.04.003; 10.1136/ard-2023-225041; 10.1002/art.41142; 10.1093/rheumatology/key162; 10.3390/biomedicines12081679; 10.1016/j.joca.2022.01.012; 10.1007/s12599-020-00658-9; 10.3390/jcm9082639; 10.1080/09638288.2024.2368057; 10.1002/pri.1952; 10.1002/pmrj.12066; 10.3389/fphys.2024.1424815; 10.1016/j.knee.2023.09.012; 10.1016/j.arth.2023.08.051; 10.1016/j.jbspin.2024.105769; 10.1038/s41598-021-89526-4; 10.1016/j.bja.2023.09.001; 10.1186/s13102-020-00211-x; 10.1016/j.jclinane.2023.111257; 10.1371/journal.pone.0308064; 10.1038/s41598-023-31038-4; 10.2196/42944; 10.3390/jcm14092968; 10.1002/acr.25270; 10.4067/s0034-98872017000700862; 10.1249/MSS.0b013e318213fefb; 10.2147/JPR.S158847; 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001288; 10.1186/s12891-018-2206-4; 10.1016/j.joca.2013.12.023; 10.1097/AJP.0b013e3181602159; 10.1179/jmt.2009.17.3.163; 10.1136/bmj.b2393; 10.2147/CIA.S441799; 10.1113/EP087712; 10.2196/38256; 10.1007/s10055-024-00979-0; 10.2147/JPR.S200498; 10.2196/48787; 10.1016/j.biocel.2019.105568; 10.2519/jospt.2022.11062; 10.1111/1756-185X.12796; 10.1007/s11999-014-3947-5; 10.1093/pm/pnz036; 10.3390/ijerph18042023; 10.1016/j.joca.2021.04.007; 10.1016/j.imu.2021.100562; 10.1186/s12891-023-06692-4; 10.2196/66037; 10.1016/j.joca.2012.06.009; 10.2147/JPR.S296273; 10.1002/j.1532-2149.2014.499.x; 10.1177/19476035221087698; 10.2519/jospt.2017.0301; 10.3109/17453674.2014.973343; 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000764; 10.1016/j.joca.2013.05.015; 10.1002/art.40752; 10.1002/art.37884; 10.1002/art.34466; 10.1016/j.pain.0000000000000022; 10.1097/AJP.0000000000000418; 10.1002/acr.20373; 10.1080/03009742.2018.1433233; 10.3390/jcm11237243; 10.1016/0304-3959(87)90089-3; 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000531; 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000055; 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1209520; 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000003073; 10.1016/j.jpain.2019.03.005; 10.36076/ppj.2012/15/ES205; 10.3791/54452; 10.1016/j.joca.2021.09.011; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.11.012; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2022.104858; 10.1016/j.ejpain.2003.09.004; 10.1136/ard.2004.022905; 10.1136/bjsports-2023-107625; 10.1016/j.otsr.2015.03.016,"The authors declare no conflicts of interest.

PROs are commonly evaluated at weekly intervals with data collected via digital surveys. While weekly assessments have benefits, VR devices enable more frequent in-device data collection. It remains unclear whether PROs collected more frequently provide more information on these interventions than PROs collected more infrequently. This pilot study explored differences between daily and weekly PRO data collection in a VR intervention with nature imagery, with and without guided imagery, among patients with cancer. Patients with cancer (n=8) were randomly assigned to one of four intervention groups: (1) virtual reality-assisted guided imagery (VRAGI), (2) VR without guided imagery, (3) desktop VR with guided imagery, or (4) desktop VR without guided imagery. Devices were mailed to participants' homes for 15-20 minutes of daily use over 3 weeks. Weekly outcomes (pain, anxiety, depression, and well-being) were assessed using items from the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. Daily outcomes were captured via in-device pre-post surveys. Data were analyzed descriptively, using visual trend comparisons to explore patterns. Of 41 patients who consented, 8 provided complete and usable data. Weekly outcomes showed no consistent trends. In contrast, daily data revealed more nuanced patterns, such as early symptom relief, plateaus, and ""double-bottom"" effects. The addition of guided imagery did not consistently enhance outcomes beyond VR alone, although the VRAGI condition showed the greatest improvement in well-being. Given the small sample size, these findings should be considered exploratory. This pilot study suggests that daily PRO data might offer richer insight into intervention effects than weekly assessments.

The study sample consisted of 100 patients assigned to the intervention group (n =&#xa0;50) or control group (n =&#xa0;50) by stratified block randomization to control for sex distribution. During the upper endoscopy procedure, patients in the intervention group watched a video of natural scenery through VR goggles. Patients in the intervention group had a significantly lower mean state anxiety score than the control group (34.62&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;7.58 vs. 40.20&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;8.27, p =&#xa0;.001).

Compassion-based therapies are time-consuming and can be challenging because of the use of mental imagery. Virtual Reality interventions enable concrete visual representations and may be more efficient. We investigated a single-session VR intervention, based on chair dialogue exercises from schema therapy, for self-criticism and self-compassion. Furthermore, the additional effect of the novel VR technique perspective change was assessed. Undergraduate students (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;68) with high levels of self-criticism were randomized to either the intervention with or without an additional perspective change. Pre- and post-measures consisted of self-report questionnaires on self-compassion, self-criticism, negative and positive affect. Participants underwent the single-session VR intervention where they had to respond assertively towards an avatar who expressed the participant's own excessive self-criticism. The perspective change consisted of a change to third person perspective. The VR intervention significantly decreased self-criticism and negative affect and increased self-compassion for both conditions directly after the session. No additional effect was found for the perspective change. This was the first study to apply VR within a schema therapy exercise. Positive effects indicate the potential of VR schema therapy for individuals with excessive self-criticism in clinical practice.

Here, we examined the neuromodulatory effects of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) - a non-invasive brain stimulation tool - on autonomic function in response to motion sickness-induced nausea. We conducted a crossover randomized controlled study of healthy participants (n = 29) administered with active taVNS and sham, concurrent with visually-induced motion sickness during electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition. Using symmetric projection attractor reconstruction (SPAR), a recent mathematical tool that computes images (""attractors"") of morphology and variability of any approximately periodic signals, we show that taVNS induces a significant reduction in measures derived from these attractor image data, compared to sham. Notably, we found that a taVNS-evoked decrease in peak theta density showed a marked correlation with improvements in motion-induced nausea symptom severity. Furthermore, the use of machine learning revealed differential discriminatory power of taVNS response with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.81. Taken together, these findings provide novel insights into taVNS for motion-induced nausea; and additionally suggest that ECG SPAR-based features may be important for evaluating taVNS therapy response - with implications for adaptive taVNS.",D006801; D009041; D055536; D005260; D008297; D000328; D004561; D018592; D055815; D004562; D000069550; D010775,Humans; Motion Sickness; Vagus Nerve Stimulation; Female; Male; Adult; Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation; Cross-Over Studies; Young Adult; Electrocardiography; Machine Learning; Photic Stimulation,NA,NA,Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"Emmanuel Molefi, Ian McLoughlin, Ramaswamy Palaniappan","School of Computing, University of Kent, Canterbury, United Kingdom.",TRUE,TRUE

Additionally, it seeks to examine whether egocentric perspective-based training enhances the near transfer effect, resulting in improved other cognitive functions compared to allocentric perspective-based training and conventional rehabilitation. 132 stroke patients (65.9% males) aged 31 to 83 (mean age 62.54&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;10.62) undergoing inpatient rehabilitation were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: allocentric (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;40) or egocentric perspective-based (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;46) selective visual attention and short-term visual memory training and control (conventional rehabilitation) group (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;46). Evaluations were performed before (at the beginning of rehabilitation for control group) and after the intervention (two weeks after pre-test for control group). The target functions included the changes in short-term visual memory, visual-spatial attention, attention-orientation, while near transfer effect included the changes in visuo-construction abilities, task switching, verbal memory, verbal fluency, language, visuo-spatial abilities, general cognitive function. To investigate how different perspectives affect selective visual attention and short-term visual memory training and near-transfer effect over time, while accounting for baseline cognitive scores, were conducted mixed repeated measures ANOVA and ANCOVA (controlled for age, years of education, lesion location, and days since stroke). A priori power analysis and effect sizes using Cohen's d<sub>z</sub> for matched pairs were calculated. The results showed that cognitive rehabilitation tasks based on egocentric perspective in combination to conventional rehabilitation are effective in improving attention-orientation and cause near transfer effect on spatial abilities and general cognitive functioning. While tasks based on allocentric perspective in combination to conventional rehabilitation are effective in improving short-term visual memory and cause near transfer effect on spatial abilities. The cognitive improvements and near-transfer effects observed in our results indicate that combining conventional rehabilitation with tasks based on egocentric and allocentric perspectives integrated in virtual reality environments can enhance rehabilitation effectiveness.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a short-term, low-dose VR nature immersion protocol (10&#xa0;min per day for 3 consecutive days) on hospitalized psychiatric patients in China. This study employed a randomized controlled trial design, enrolling 60 inpatients diagnosed with depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. Seven participants withdrew, leaving 27 in the VR nature group and 26 in the VR city control group. Intervention effects were measured using multidimensional indicators, including psychological scales, physiological indicators, and immediate emotion. The VR nature group exhibited significant reductions in perceived stress, depression, and anxiety, along with significantly increased connectedness to nature. Physiological data indicated that the VR nature group had significantly lower heart rates compared to the control group. After a single VR session, the VR nature group demonstrated a significant improvement in positive emotions and a marked reduction in negative emotions. This research provides evidence that short-term VR nature immersion effectively alleviates stress and emotional in hospitalized psychiatric patients.

However, high-quality evidence is needed to support its implementation in clinical practice. This study evaluated the clinical effects of a 12-week VR-based stationary cycling program on depressive symptoms in sedentary adults with mild to moderate depression. This study is a 12-week, 3-arm randomized controlled double-blind trial. Participants (aged 18-60 years) with depression were recruited from a clinic and randomly assigned (1:1:1) to the VR high-intensity stationary cycling, VR moderate-intensity stationary cycling, or non-VR moderate-intensity stationary cycling group to receive face-to-face intervention. The primary outcome was the change in depressive symptoms measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) between baseline and 12 weeks. Response rate, remission rate, satisfaction, compliance, and adverse events were assessed post intervention. Outcomes were analyzed using an ITT approach. Between January 2023 and June 2024, a total of 114 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to 3 groups (38 per group), with 101 completing the trial (33 in non-VR moderate-intensity stationary cycling, 35 in VR moderate-intensity cycling, and 33 in VR high-intensity cycling). All 114 randomly assigned participants were included in the ITT analysis. After the 12-week intervention, all groups showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms, as reflected by the mean difference in HAMD-17 scores within groups from baseline to week 12: non-VR moderate intensity (mean difference within groups: 10.9, 95% CI 9.3-12.5; response rate: 58%, remission rate: 40%); VR moderate intensity (mean difference within groups: 14.2, 95% CI 12.7-15.8; response rate: 84%, remission rate: 74%); and VR high intensity (mean difference within groups: 14.4, 95% CI 13.0-15.8; response rate: 92%, remission rate: 74%). VR-based groups showed greater reductions than the non-VR group (mean difference between groups: 3.3, 95% CI 1.9-4.9, for VR moderate-intensity; mean difference between groups: 3.9, 95% CI 2.5-5.2, for VR high intensity). No significant difference in symptom improvement was found between the 2 VR groups, although the moderate-intensity group reported higher satisfaction. The VR stationary cycling program is an efficacious health intervention for alleviating depressive symptoms in participants with mild to moderate depression. These findings could facilitate incorporating VR health intervention into clinical practice, enhance the response of cycling-based interventions, and improve patient adherence, supporting its use as a complementary treatment for depression.",D006801; D000328; D005260; D008297; D003863; D008875; D000076142; D055815; D004311; D000293; D001642; D005081,Humans; Adult; Female; Male; Depression; Middle Aged; Virtual Reality; Young Adult; Double-Blind Method; Adolescent; Bicycling; Exercise Therapy,NA,10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30511-X; 10.1016/j.jad.2016.12.033; 10.1177/0269881115581093; 10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1305295; 10.1016/j.ijchp.2024.100447; 10.1136/bmj-2023-075847; 10.1038/s41598-023-39783-2; 10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1207243; 10.1016/j.pcad.2023.02.008; 10.1136/bjsports-2022-106282; 10.7554/eLife.15092; 10.17116/jnevro2019119071112; 10.1016/j.psychres.2019.112601; 10.1002/da.22842; 10.1016/j.jad.2016.04.030; 10.3390/healthcare9070883; 10.1016/j.nedt.2019.104207; 10.1007/978-3-030-37639-0_4; 10.1007/s00391-010-0124-7; 10.3233/ADR-230099; 10.3390/jcm7030042; 10.1177/1471301220951328; 10.1080/09638288.2020.1800833; 10.1089/cyber.2017.0042; 10.1371/journal.pone.0118470; 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31325-3; 10.1159/000494659; 10.1007/s40520-016-0595-5; 10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.065; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2018.01.015; 10.3389/fnins.2018.00498; 10.1016/j.apmr.2013.03.029; 10.1016/j.ypmed.2016.08.011; 10.1123/jsep.30.5.471; 10.2165/11590680-000000000-00000; 10.2174/1871527313666140612102841,<b>Conflicts of Interest:</b> None declared.,"Na Zhang, Chenlu Hong, Yuejia Wang, Haiqin Chen, Yueli Zhu, Miao Da, Zhongxia Shen, Xudong Zhao, Jiali Xu,  ..., Meiying Xu","Huzhou Third Municipal Hospital, No. 2088 Tiaoxiao East Road, Wuxing District, Huzhou City, Zhejiang Province, Huzhou, Zhejiang, 313000, China, 86 13757289010.",TRUE,TRUE

Eighty-four men with SAD were selected through convenience sampling and randomly assigned to either an experimental group (<i>n</i>&#x202f;=&#x202f;42) or a control group (<i>n</i>&#x202f;=&#x202f;42). The experimental group participated in VR extreme sports sessions. Psychological symptoms were measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and data were analyzed via Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). Normality of data distribution was confirmed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (<i>p</i>&#x202f;&gt;&#x202f;0.05), and Levene's test also confirmed the homogeneity of variances (<i>p</i>&#x202f;&gt;&#x202f;0.05), supporting the use of ANCOVA to compare adjusted post-test scores between groups. The VR-based intervention led to significant reductions across all three measured domains. Depression (<i>&#x3b7;</i> <sup>2</sup>&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.916), anxiety (<i>&#x3b7;</i> <sup>2</sup>&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.901), and stress (<i>&#x3b7;</i> <sup>2</sup>&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.829) levels showed substantial improvement in the experimental group compared to the control group. These findings highlight the promise of VR-based extreme sports as a novel, non-pharmacological intervention for men with SAD. By enabling controlled exposure to anxiety-provoking situations within a safe and immersive environment, the intervention effectively alleviated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Moreover, this approach may overcome common treatment barriers such as stigma and reluctance toward traditional therapy. Future large-scale, longitudinal studies are recommended to validate these outcomes and explore their long-term sustainability.",D000328; D006801; D008297; D008875; D001007; D003863; D000072861; D013177; D013315; D000088544,"Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Anxiety; Depression; Phobia, Social; Sports; Stress, Psychological; Exergaming",NA,10.1002/da.20759; 10.1016/j.ssmqr.2023.100356; 10.2196/26736; 10.1097/EBP.0000000000001075; 10.1186/s13063-022-07046-6; 10.1177/1359105312446770; 10.1080/07448481.2021.1942008; 10.51871/2588-0500_2022_06_01_12; 10.3390/ijerph19116381; 10.3390/bs14010076; 10.1186/s13102-022-00592-1; 10.1177/20503121241258736; 10.1186/s13643-023-02264-8; 10.22514/jomh.2024.172; 10.1177/03080226241261178; 10.1186/s13018-017-0560-9; 10.7759/cureus.64573; 10.1016/j.janxdis.2016.06.007; 10.1038/s41598-021-84190-0; 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00158; 10.1038/s41746-017-0013-1; 10.1016/j.nsa.2024.104074; 10.1016/j.janxdis.2018.08.003; 10.3389/fpubh.2024.1422246; 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1546478; 10.1016/j.apergo.2018.01.009; 10.3390/bs14080695; 10.3390/healthcare13080859; 10.1016/j.janxdis.2007.04.006; 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01758; 10.21270/archi.v13i7.5908; 10.1016/j.brat.2015.12.016; 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02763; 10.1080/10615806.2024.2392195; 10.1002/capr.12765; 10.3390/jcm12134525; 10.12746/swrccc.v10i43.951; 10.4324/9780203771587; 10.1037/t39835-000,The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.,"Li Wang, Hossein Faridniya, Haiyang Yu","Sports Institute, Nanchang Institute of Technology, Jiangxi, China.",TRUE,TRUE

Twenty-four fourth-year dental students from the University of Valencia were randomly assigned to two groups (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;12 each). One group performed pulpotomy training first with a mannequin-based model and then with HVRS, while the other group followed the reverse sequence. Both training modalities involved standardised instruction and hands-on practice. Following both sessions, participants completed a 12-item Likert-scale survey assessing perspectives of realism, skill acquisition, confidence and overall satisfaction. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U tests and Spearman correlation analyses were used to examine group differences and item associations. In addition to self-reported data, procedural timing was also recorded to provide complementary objective insight into student performance. Students in the HVRS group reported significantly higher agreement on items related to tactile realism, differentiation of tooth structures and improvement of fine motor skills. Strong correlations were observed between perceived realism and confidence (&#x3c1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.88), as well as between satisfaction and the desire to apply HVRS in additional procedures (&#x3c1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.00). The internal consistency of the questionnaire was high (Cronbach's &#x3b1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.91). HVRS was perceived as a realistic and motivating tool for pulpotomy training in paediatric dentistry.

We investigated the effects of VR-based cognitive behavior therapy for paranoid ideation (VR-CBTp) compared to standard CBTp. We conducted a pragmatic, single-blind, randomized clinical trial in seven mental health centers across the Netherlands and Belgium. A total of 98 participants with a psychotic spectrum disorder and paranoid ideation were randomized to a maximum of 16 sessions of VR-CBTp (<i>n</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;48) or CBTp (<i>n</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;50). The primary outcome was momentary paranoia, measured with the experience sampling method (ESM) at posttreatment. Secondary measures, assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up, included symptoms (paranoia, hallucination, depression, cognition, and anxiety related), social functioning, self-esteem, and schemes. Both groups showed reductions in momentary paranoia between baseline and posttreatment (<i>n</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;56, <i>b</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;-15.0, effect size [ES]&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.65), but those were greater for VR-CBT (interaction <i>b</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;8.3, ES&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.62).

Current treatment options have suboptimal response rates and innovative interventions are needed. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel immersive virtual reality-assisted therapy (Challenge-VRT) for auditory verbal hallucinations. In this randomised, assessor-masked, parallel-group superiority clinical trial, patients with schizophrenia were recruited from outpatient psychiatric services across three Danish regions. Key inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older, auditory verbal hallucinations for at least 3 months, and insufficient symptom response to antipsychotic medication. Exclusion criteria included being unable to identify a dominant voice, current substance dependence, and organic brain disorder. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) via a secure web-based system using permuted blocks (block size 12), stratified by site and antipsychotic treatment. Allocation was concealed from outcome assessors. Participants were assigned to either Challenge-VRT (seven weekly immersive virtual reality sessions plus two booster sessions) or a control intervention of enhanced treatment-as-usual, matched in frequency and duration. Challenge-VRT was co-developed with individuals with lived experience of auditory verbal hallucinations. The primary outcome was clinician-rated auditory verbal hallucination severity measured by the Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scales-Auditory Hallucinations total score (PSYRATS-AH) at 12 weeks post baseline. Secondary outcomes were PSYRATS-AH frequency, PSYRATS-AH-Distress, The Voice Power Differential Scale, the Voices Acceptance and Action Scale, the Assertive Responding to Voices subscale from the Approve-Voices, and the Personal and Social Performance Scale, all at 12 weeks. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle and used linear mixed models. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04661163, and is now completed. Between Nov 16, 2020, and June 14, 2023, 399 patients were referred for potential study inclusion, 62 patients were excluded (declined to participate or unable to be contacted), and 337 were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 66 did not meet the inclusion criteria. 271 participants were randomly assigned to Challenge-VRT (n=140) or enhanced treatment-as-usual (n=131). One participant was excluded post-randomisation, resulting in 270 included in the analysis of all outcomes. Participants had a mean age of 32&#xb7;83 years (SD 11&#xb7;9, range 18-72), 105 (39%) were male, and 165 (61%) were female. No data on ethnicity were collected. At 12 weeks, Challenge-VRT significantly reduced auditory verbal hallucination severity compared with enhanced treatment-as-usual on the PSYRATS-AH (adjusted mean difference -2&#xb7;26 [95% CI -4&#xb7;26 to -0&#xb7;25]; p=0&#xb7;027; Cohen's d, 0&#xb7;27). Among secondary outcomes, a significant reduction in PSYRATS-AH frequency was observed in the Challenge-VRT group at both 12 weeks (adjusted mean difference -0&#xb7;84 [95% CI -1&#xb7;53 to -0&#xb7;14]; p=0&#xb7;018) and 24 weeks (adjusted mean difference -0&#xb7;86 [95% CI -1&#xb7;65 to -0&#xb7;07]; p=0&#xb7;034). No significant differences were found for other secondary outcomes. The intervention was generally well tolerated. Six serious adverse events occurred that might have been related to the Challenge-VRT intervention (five cases of hospital admission due to exacerbation of auditory verbal hallucinations and one episode of self-harm). No deaths occurred during the trial. Challenge-VRT showed short-term efficacy in reducing the severity of auditory verbal hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia, and the findings support further development and evaluation of immersive virtual reality-based therapies in this population.

However, much remains unknown about the effectiveness of VR for CMP. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of VR in daily life versus no treatment for people with CMP who were on a waiting list to receive secondary pain treatment. This study employed a cluster-randomised, controlled design. The intervention group received a novel VR application that offers pain education and pain management techniques. This home-based, stand-alone, immersive VR intervention was advised to be used daily for four weeks. The control group received no treatment. Primary outcome measure was health-related quality of life at four weeks; secondary outcome measures included various pain-related variables (e.g., pain self-efficacy). Intervention effectiveness was analysed using linear mixed models. Fifty-three participants were included in this trial (mean age: 55.5 (SD: 15)) of which 70% were women. No significant between-group differences were found at four weeks on physical (mean difference (95% CI): 0.039 (-2.810 to 2.889), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.978) or mental (3.590 (-1.640 to 8.819), p =&#x2009;0.172) health-related quality of life or any of the secondary outcome measures.

While surgical decompression is the primary treatment, over 40% of patients report residual hand disability after surgery. There are no therapies to restore hand function after surgery for DCM. In this single-arm clinical trial, post-surgical DCM participants (within 12 months after surgery) underwent a 4-week VR training protocol using the Virtual Keyboard system, which promotes practice of finger individuation. Assessments of hand dexterity were performed at baseline (at week 1), post-training (at week 6) and follow-up (at week 10). The primary outcome measure for hand dexterity assessment was the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT). Twenty-two post-surgical DCM participants were included in the final analysis. Statistically significant improvement in the JTHFT was observed at both post-training (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, &#x394;= -15.21s) and follow-up (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, &#x394;= -17.84s), with changes exceeding the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) at both time points.

Multisensory stimulation has been suggested as an effective method to enhance the SP in VR environments. This study aims to investigate the relationship between SP and anxiety in a VR environment designed to simulate fear of heights (FoH). Specifically, it compares the levels of SP and anxiety experienced in multisensory (i.e., visual, auditory and tactile stimulation) versus bisensory (i.e., visual and auditory stimulation) virtual environments and examines the associations between SP and individual characteristics. A total of 162 participants were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: bisensory virtual reality exposure (B-VRE; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;85) and multisensory virtual reality exposure (M-VRE; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;77). Differences in anxiety and SP between the two conditions were assessed using Student's t-tests. In addition, correlation, mediation and moderation analyses were conducted to explore the relationships between SP, anxiety, technological features and individual characteristics. Correlation analyses revealed statistically significant relationships between SP and anxiety during VR exposure, as well as between SP and participants' demographic and personality characteristics. Furthermore, SP partially mediated the relationship between participants' baseline FoH and the anxiety they experienced in the VR environment. Finally, the addition of multisensory cues increased the SP experienced in the virtual scenario but did not significantly impact reported anxiety levels. Incorporating multisensory feedback to enhance SP during VRET should be considered when designing VR systems for therapeutic use. Adding multisensory cues enhances users' sense of presence in virtual environments. Sense of presence partially mediates the link between fear of heights and anxiety during VR exposure. Incorporating multisensory elements can improve the effectiveness of VR-based therapy.",D006801; D008297; D005260; D063367; D000328; D055815; D000076142; D005239; D010698,Humans; Male; Female; Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy; Adult; Young Adult; Virtual Reality; Fear; Phobic Disorders,NA,NA,NA,"Jos&#xe9; Mar&#xed;a Rib&#xe9;-Vi&#xf1;es, Jos&#xe9; Guti&#xe9;rrez-Maldonado, Zahra Zabolipour, Miriam Aguilar-Gil, Marta Ferrer-Garcia","Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychobiology, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.",TRUE,TRUE

Sensory-motor (SN) and virtual reality (VR) interventions have shown promise in addressing these balance issues by engaging all three components of the balance control systems. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of sensory-motor and virtual reality training on the functional status and quality of life of MS patients. In this study, 36 MS patients receiving Rituximab therapy with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 2 to 6 were randomly assigned to three groups: SN (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;10), VR (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8), and a control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;10). The SN and VR groups underwent 8 weeks of intervention, with 3 sessions per week, while the control group continued routine care. Assessments using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) test, the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 Instrument (MSQOL54), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were conducted at baseline and after 8 weeks. Significant within-group improvements were observed in both SN and VR groups for primary outcomes, including the T25FW (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002 for SN; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001 for VR) and TUG (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005 for SN; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001 for VR), as well as secondary outcomes such as overall (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001 for both), physical (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001 for both), and mental (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001 for both) MSQOL-54 components, and PSQI (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001 for SN; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046 for VR). However, no significant differences emerged between SN and VR groups for primary outcomes, except for PSQI, which favored SN (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). Compared to the control group, the SN group demonstrated significant improvements in primary outcomes-T25FW (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and TUG (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01)-and secondary outcomes, including overall (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), physical (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and mental (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) MSQOL-54 components, and PSQI (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007). Similarly, compared to the control group, the VR group demonstrated significant improvements in the T25FW (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) and TUG (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05) tests, as well as in secondary outcomes, including overall (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005), physical (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003), and mental (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) MSQOL-54 components. However, no significant improvement in PSQI was observed (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.9). This study highlights the significant transformative potential of integrating VR and SN interventions as innovative therapeutic modalities for addressing critical motor impairments, specifically balance and gait, in individuals with MS. By employing task-oriented paradigms, dual-task methodologies, and multisensory frameworks, these interventions not only yield substantial improvements in functional mobility and quality of life but also represent a groundbreaking synthesis of immersive, technology-driven motivation with the pragmatic adaptability of evidence-based SN techniques.

This study aimed to clarify how VR-WM training improves WM in patients with MDD and further explore the role of the frontotemporal lobe in related neural mechanisms. A total of 57 patients with MDD were included in a randomized controlled study to clarify the effects of 20 sessions of VR-WM training on WM in patients with MDD and to explore the role of the frontotemporal lobe in associated neural mechanisms. The Stroop color word test, 2-back task, digit task switching, and digit span test were used to measure the inhibition, updating and switching functions of WM and WM span. The functional features of the frontotemporal lobe in patients with MDD at rest were detected using functional near-infrared spectroscopy before and after training. After VR-WM training, patients with MDD exhibited significant improvements in the accuracy of the Stroop color word test (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.013) and 2-back task (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002), the scores of digit span test (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.030) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.006).

We developed a virtual reality sports system, named REVERIE (Real-World Exercise and VR-Based Exercise Research in Education), which used deep reinforcement learning to train transformer-based virtual coaching agents, offering immersive and effective sports guidance, with biomechanical performance comparable to real-world physical sports. We integrated REVERIE into a randomized controlled trial involving an 8-week intervention in adolescents with excess body weight (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;227). Participants were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to physical table tennis, physical soccer, REVERIE table tennis, REVERIE soccer or control. REVERIE sports intervention was effective in reducing primary outcome fat mass (mean -4.28&#x2009;kg (95% confidence interval (CI) -6.35 to -2.22), relative to control), with no significant difference compared with physical sports (mean -5.06&#x2009;kg (95% CI -7.13 to -2.98), relative to control). For secondary outcomes, decreases in liver enzymes and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were found in physical and REVERIE sports groups compared to control. Physical and REVERIE sports showed improvements in physical fitness, psychological well-being and sports willingness after an 8-week intervention, which remained at the 6-month follow-up in the REVERIE sports group. REVERIE sports demonstrated superior cognitive enhancements compared to physical sports in exploratory analyses, as evidenced by olfactory tests (total score: mean 2.84 (95% CI 1.15 to 4.53)) and working memory paradigm (2-back accuracy: mean 10.88% (95% CI 1.19% to 20.56%)). Functional magnetic resonance imaging exhibited that REVERIE sports enhanced neural efficiency and neuroplasticity. Multi-omics analyses revealed distinct changes induced by REVERIE sports that were closely associated with cognitive improvement. Minimal injury rates were 7.69% for REVERIE and 13.48% for physical sports, with no serious adverse events.

Participants scoring &#x2265;10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 or &#x2265;9 on the Panic Disorder Severity Scale were allocated to a group with DAS while others were assigned to a HC group. The DAS group was subsequently randomized into VR-based BF or conventional BF interventions with a therapist. All participants attended sessions at weeks 0, 2, and 4, completing assessments including the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Visual Analog Scale in interviews. The PSQI was administered at baseline and postintervention to evaluate alterations in sleep quality over a 4-week period. A total of 118 participants were randomized into a VR-based BF group (DAS/VR, n=40) or a conventional BF group (DAS/BF, n=38), and a control group (HC/VR, n=40) received VR-based BF. Sleep disturbance scores of both DAS/VR and DAS/BF groups had significant improvements (mean reductions of -0.58, SD 0.75 and -0.66, SD 0.75, respectively) compared to those preintervention, showing no significant difference after adjusting for age and sex (P=.49). The DAS/VR group had a greater improvement in sleep disturbance (mean -0.08, SD 0.53; P=0.0014) than the HC/VR group. Global PSQI scores in both DAS/VR and DAS/BF groups improved compared to those preintervention, showing decreases by -2.50 (SD 2.89) and -3.39 (SD 2.80), respectively.

The Global PSQI score in the DAS/VR group showed significant improvement (-0.95, SD 2.09; P=.01) compared to that in the HC/VR group. This study provides evidence that both VR-based BF and conventional BF with a therapist are efficacious psychological interventions for enhancing sleep quality in individuals with depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, or both, with no significant differences observed between these 2 approaches.

This study aimed to assess the impact of manipulating visual-proprioceptive feedback using virtual reality (VR) during lumbar flexion on movement-evoked pain thresholds. Additionally, we explored whether individuals with elevated pain, kinesiophobia, and catastrophizing were more susceptible to visual-proprioceptive manipulation. Fifty participants with non-specific chronic low back pain (cLBP) were included. We assessed lumbar flexion-evoked pain thresholds alongside pain levels, pain interference, kinesiophobia, and catastrophizing. Participants performed lumbar flexion movements in three conditions: (1) without VR (control, F), (2) with a virtual illusion shortening the perceived arm length by 20% (understated condition, F-), and (3) with a virtual illusion elongating arm length by 20% (overstated condition, F&#x2009;+). Range of motion (ROM) was measured using an electro-goniometer. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc tests examined differences among conditions, and three two-sample t-tests explored whether individuals with higher pain, kinesiophobia, and catastrophizing were more affected by visual-proprioceptive manipulation. Understating the flexion task (F-) led to a 5% increase in movement compared to the control (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04; 95% CI [0.6%, 10.7%]) and a 7% increase compared to the overstated condition (F&#x2009;+) (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; 95% CI [2.6%, 11.6%]). Additionally, individuals with higher pain levels and pain interference, exhibited a more pronounced response to the understated condition (F-). Manipulating visual-proprioceptive feedback through VR significantly influenced pain thresholds during lumbar flexion in cLBP patients. The understated condition (F-) extended pain-free movement, delaying pain onset. Furthermore, pain intensity and interference modulated susceptibility to visual feedback manipulation. These findings enhance our understanding of how visual-proprioceptive feedback influences pain perception and movement patterns in cLBP. They suggest new avenues for pain assessment, therapeutic interventions, and clinical strategies, particularly for individuals with high pain levels, interference, kinesiophobia, and catastrophizing.

Unfortunately, these tests can be distressing for children, causing pain and fear that can make them challenging to conduct. Virtual reality (VR) can be used to distract children during medical procedures. This study examines the effect of VR on skin prick test-related pain and fear in children. This parallel-group, single-blind, prospective, randomized controlled trial enrolled 233 children evaluated at the Pediatric Allergy Clinic and scheduled to undergo skin prick testing between March and June 2024. Among these children, 75 children aged 4-10&#xa0;years who met the inclusion criteria were divided into two groups as VR group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;25) and control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;25) by block randomization using gender and age group variables. The VR group wore VR goggles during the skin prick test, while the control group underwent the standard procedure. Pain and fear levels were assessed using the Wong-Baker FACES&#xae; Pain Scale and the Child Fear Scale. Children in the VR group exhibited a significant reduction in pain and fear levels associated with the skin prick test experience compared to the control group, as evaluated by children, parents, and researchers (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). No side effects related to VR were reported. Virtual reality can be an effective tool in pediatric allergy clinics to reduce pain and fear during skin prick testing. By enhancing the child's comfort, VR may also improve adherence to allergy follow-up and treatment, ultimately contributing to better clinical outcomes. &#x2022; Children often experience significant pain and fear during invasive procedures such as skin prick tests, and distraction methods have been shown to reduce pain and anxiety. &#x2022; This study is the first randomized controlled trial to demonstrate that virtual reality (VR) significantly reduces pain and fear during skin prick tests in children. &#x2022; This study supports the integration of new technologies such as VR as a standard practice for managing pain and fear during skin prick tests in pediatric allergy clinics.

Immersive virtual reality (IVR) offers an innovative alternative to traditional methods by providing interactive and realistic three-dimensional images of neurological structures. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of IVR for learning neuroanatomy and to assess student satisfaction and motivation. We conducted a single-blind randomized controlled trial with 67&#x2009;second-year physiotherapy students. Besides didactic lectures, students were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first was an IVR group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;34), in which students studied autonomously using the MetaQuest 2 IVR device with the SharecareYOU VR application (60&#x2009;min), after having received instructions on how to use it (30&#x2009;min). The second group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;33) followed a traditional learning approach using anatomical atlases and textbooks (90&#x2009;min). Knowledge retention was assessed through an 18-item questionnaire, while satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and usability of the IVR headset were evaluated using other questionnaires. Evaluations were carried out immediately after the intervention, and four weeks later. The IVR group demonstrated significantly higher knowledge retention overall (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) as well as in specific areas, such as theoretical understanding, spatial location, and labeling of brain areas (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). No statistically significant differences were maintained 4&#x2009;weeks after the intervention (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.37). Additionally, IVR students reported greater satisfaction (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and found it useful for learning (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) without adverse events.

Our aim was to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of a novel exergaming experience called neuroanimation, in the form of MindPod<sup>TM</sup> Dolphin, added to an intensive physiotherapy program for Parkinson's disease (PD). MindPod Dolphin provides a 2D oceanic environment where patients make high-amplitude 3D arm movements controlling an animated dolphin. We conducted a rater-blinded, randomized-controlled trial. Eligible people with PD were assigned into two groups: MindPod Dolphin over 12-weeks combined with physiotherapy (COM) or sequentially after 6-weeks of physiotherapy alone (SEQ). Sessions occurred three times/week. Assessments occurred at baseline, 6-week, 12-week, and 4-week post-intervention. The primary outcome was change from baseline to 6-week in the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Secondary outcomes were change, from baseline to each evaluation timepoint, in several motor, cognitive and quality of life measures. Participants' safety was assessed. Adherence, system usability and participants' satisfaction were used as measures of feasibility. Thirty individuals were recruited. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Our primary outcome (change in TUG from baseline to 6-week) did not significantly differ between groups [median TUG change in COM&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.243 [-1.873, 1.176] vs. SEQ=-0.016 [-0.810, 0.350], estimated difference&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002 (95%CI -1.103; 1.273); p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.983]. Both groups improved in motor and cognitive measures with a trend favoring COM. When compared to SEQ, COM improved significantly in TUG cognitive from baseline to 16-week (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.048). A main effect of time was observed for TUG cognitive in COM, and mini-BEST in SEQ. Adverse events (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;309) were mostly mild (55%). Overall, 20 participants (67%) adhered to the study protocol, with the COM being more compliant than the SEQ group. MindPod Dolphin was considered easy to use and over 80% of participants were at least moderately satisfied with it as an intervention. Neuroanimation-based exergaming in PD was feasible, safe and effective in improving multiple secondary measures. The advantages of the exergame became evident at 12-weeks and beyond, suggesting that it had cumulative and delayed beneficial effects on cognitive and motor outcomes when added to a lead-in phase of intense physiotherapy.

In the application group, parents implemented physical activities recommended by ChatGPT for their children with ASD. Data were collected using the Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (LTEQ) and a feasibility questionnaire. Parents reported that ChatGPT-delivered physical activities were a feasible intervention to increase physical activity levels in children with ASD. They also found the activity content suggested by ChatGPT to be interesting and useful. LTEQ measurements corroborated these findings, showing a significant increase in the physical activity levels of children in the intervention group after the intervention.

The follow-up period covers 1 week. In this prospective randomized controlled trial, patients were allocated to either a control group, which received standard exercise therapy, or a virtual reality group, which utilized virtual reality software and equipment for active exercises. Patients were followed for 1 week. The study compared compliance, safety, and rehabilitative outcomes between these groups. Data were analysed using a linear mixed-effects model. Patients in the virtual reality-based exercise group exhibited significantly higher levels of average daily exercise time, out-of-bed exercise time, and overall exercise compliance compared with the control group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). There were no reports of adverse events related to exercise in either group. Notably, within the first week of intervention, the virtual reality-based exercise group showed significant improvements in various parameters, including muscle strength, grip strength, body mass index, and the Barthel Index, outperforming the control group in these areas (all p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Based on 1 week of follow-up data, the study confirms that virtual reality-based exercise modalities are more efficacious than traditional exercise approaches in enhancing exercise duration, compliance, and various health outcomes in Respiratory Intensive Care Unit patients.

This study was conducted to determine the effects of using a thermomechanical stimulation device and virtual reality glasses on pain and patient satisfaction during peripheral intravenous catheterization procedure in adult patients. The research was conducted as a randomized controlled experimental study between June 2021 and February 2022. The sample consisted of 126 voluntarily participating patients. Patients were randomized homogeneously according to sex into the thermomechanical stimulation group, the virtual reality glasses group, or the control group. During peripheral intravenous catheterization procedures, patients in the thermomechanical stimulation group were treated with a cold vibrating device and patients in the virtual reality glasses group were shown a nature video. Data were collected using a baseline demographics form and a visual analog scale. The pain visual analog scale ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 being the best, and the satisfaction visual analog scale ranges from 0 to 10, with 10 being the best. The study was conducted based on Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines, and the ClinicalTrials.gov ID number of the study is NCT05422287. Visual analog scale pain scores with mean (SD) for the virtual reality glasses, thermomechanical stimulation, and control groups were 2.71 (SD 1.45) 2.66 (SD 1.22), and 4.85 SD (1.71), respectively.

We found significant and strong correlations between performance on sensory tests and the responses to visual perturbations, and improvements in the responses with SR. Only one predictor could be entered into the MRA, indicating that performance on any of the sensory tests could predict the responses to visual perturbation and the improvements with SR.

Two hundred participants, requesting a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD, were 1:1 computer randomized in either the VR group, where participants wore VR goggles, or in the standard-of-care group. The primary outcome is the patient's overall experience assessed by means of a Visual Analog Scale (VAS; 0-100&#xa0;mm, continuous, higher is better).

The BTS Nirvana system, equipped with infrared sensors and real-time audiovisual feedback, enables objective performance recording and supports task-oriented, intensive exercises. This study evaluates the combined effect of VR therapy using BTS Nirvana and conventional rehabilitation on upper extremity functions in subacute stroke patients. This randomized, controlled, single-masked study included 22 subacute hemiplegic patients divided into a virtual reality group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11) and a control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11). Both groups received conventional therapy for three weeks, with the VR group undergoing additional sessions using the BTS Nirvana system. Upper extremity functions were assessed using the Fugl-Meyer upper extremity scale, Brunnstrom stage, Functional Reach Test, Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity tests, and range of motion measurements. Both groups showed significant improvements (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) in most outcomes, except for shoulder adduction (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.222) and shoulder external rotation (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.113). Intergroup analysis favored the VR group for upper extremity Brunnstrom stage (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.030), shoulder external rotation (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.029), and Chedoke arm test scores (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.039). Time-group interaction analysis also highlighted superior improvements in the VR group for these measures (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). The BTS Nirvana system is a safe and effective complement to conventional therapy, offering intensive and repetitive training for upper extremity rehabilitation in subacute stroke patients.

Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) and virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) are effective treatment approaches for SAD. However, few studies have integrated both, particularly in Chinese communities. This study examines the effectiveness of a 14-week iCBT program that includes VRET, called ""Ease Anxiety in Social Event Online"" (Ease Online), among Hong Kong adults with SAD. 329 Hong Kong Chinese adults with SAD were randomized into web-based iCBT with VRET (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;117), app-based iCBT with VRET (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;111), or waitlist control (WLC) (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;101) groups. The mean age was 30.49&#xa0;years old (SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;9.34), with 36&#xa0;% male and 64&#xa0;% female. Assessments were administered at pre-test, post-test, and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. The primary outcome measure was the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN). Data were analysed by using linear regression and mixed effects models. Both treatment groups were superior to WLC group on both the primary and secondary outcome measures. The effects were comparable between the two iCBT formats. Improvements were maintained at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. The rate of reliable improvement based on the SPIN was 34&#xa0;% and 40&#xa0;% in the web-based and app-based iCBT groups, respectively, compared to 11&#xa0;% in the WLC group; and 15&#xa0;% and 23&#xa0;% who meet the criteria for remission of social anxiety, compared to 3&#xa0;% in the WLC group.

A single-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted with 55 young adults aged 18 to 25 years. The intervention, based on the RAM, comprised six sessions focusing on psychoeducation, relaxation, and cognitive restructuring. VR was integrated into four of the sessions, aiming to simulate social situations and provide real-time feedback. Data were collected using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), Life Satisfaction Scale (LSS), and an individual introduction form, with pretest, posttest, and follow-up measurements. LSAS scores indicated that the intervention had a significant positive impact on the experimental group regarding anxiety (<i>F</i> = 24.005, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and avoidance (<i>F</i> = 44.915, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), as well as total scale scores. However, LSS scores revealed no significant differences between experimental and control groups (<i>F</i> = 0.429, <i>p</i> = 0.654). Nursing interventions based on the VR-integrated RAM significantly reduced social anxiety among young adults.

This multicenter study evaluated the efficacy of a novel immersive virtual reality (iVR) cognitive training (CT) targeting executive functions (EF)-planning, shifting, and updating abilities-to improve prospective memory (PM) in PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). Potential transfer effects were also examined in healthy older adults (HC). In this double-blind randomized controlled trial, 30 PD-MCI were randomized into a 4-week EF-training (PD-CT) or active placebo (PD-AP), delivered at home through a combined approach of telemedicine and iVR. Similarly, 30 age- and education-matched HC were assigned to the EF-training (HC-CT) or active placebo (HC-AP). The PD-CT group exhibited significant improvements in PM (in time-based and verbal-response tasks) and in EF, particularly in inhibition abilities (in the Stroop test), with effects sustained at 2-month follow-up. These gains were absent in the PD-AP group. Regression analyses revealed that PM enhancements were primarily driven by improved inhibition and shifting abilities. The EF-training was effective also in the older adults, the HC-CT group showed improvements in planning abilities (in the Zoo Map test) at post-intervention and 2-month follow-up, while no cognitive gains were observed in the HC-AP group. This innovative iVR-based EF-training effectively enhances PM and inhibition in PD-MCI, and planning abilities in healthy older adults, demonstrating its potential for improving cognition in both populations.

Virtual reality (VR) has been introduced into spine surgery training within safe environments. So far, no existing studies have comprehensively evaluated the potential benefits of VR in training residents in ACDF field. This study aims to develop the VR based ACDF training system and evaluate the effect of VR on surgical training for residents. A VR simulation module for ACDF training was developed, involving 19 interactive operation steps. Residents of postgraduate years (PGY) 1-3 in our spine center were randomly assigned to VR training (VR group) and standard programmatic training (ST group). The test on ACDF surgery knowledge was conducted as cognitive evaluation, attitudes toward training were evaluated with the neurosurgical evaluation of attitudes towards simulation training (NEAT) tool, self-efficacy evaluation by using the general self-efficacy scale (GSES), and a performance questionnaire was used to evaluate the performance of all participants. A total of 60 residents were included in this study, with 30 in VR group and 30 in ST group. No significant differences were observed in terms of the demographic data such as age, gender, PGY between the two groups.

Forty-three adults were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: the experimental group or the waitlist group. Both groups attended initial short online education. The experimental group consecutively attended three VR-based exposure therapy (VRET) intervention sessions over 3-5 weeks during which the therapist encouraged participants to enter the predefined feared situations, while the control group on the waitlist had no additional intervention. The findings show that a 3-session VR exposure intervention with a standardized set of tasks effectively reduces the level of experienced height intolerance and particularly avoidance behavior compared to the control waitlist group limited to psychoeducation only. Results were maintained at the 2 months follow-up. The higher the sense of presence after the VR exposure was, the lower the avoidance level rated in the follow-up. Our study has some limitations, such as potential sample selection bias and tracking of only medium-term effects in the 2-month follow-up.

We previously demonstrated the superior effects of Proficiency-Based Progression (PBP) training on implanters' performance in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Beforehand, we conducted a 'pilot' study to evaluate the robustness of PBP training, hypothesizing that a substantial majority of trainees would achieve the target proficiency after training. In this international, prospective, single-arm study, novice implanters completed a metrics-based simulation training curriculum, requiring proficiency benchmark demonstration at each stage to advance. Trainees ultimately performed a cardiac resynchronization therapy implant on virtual reality simulation which was video-recorded and then scored using validated Metrics (Steps, Critical Errors, Errors non-critical) by independent assessors. The primary outcome was the number of trainees meeting the benchmark. Findings informed corrective actions for the subsequent RCT training, whose effectiveness was verified by comparing PBP-trained participants from the pilot study (PBP-PILOT) and the RCT (PBP-RCT) on Steps completed, All Errors, and benchmark achievement. Only 17&#xa0;% achieved the proficiency benchmark. Investigations revealed insufficient faculty adherence to the PBP methodology resulting in premature trainee advancement.

This study evaluated an important research gap, the negative and positive side effects of VERP and its safety. Eighty outpatients with contamination- or checking-related OCD were randomized to two conditions: VERP (six weekly sessions) or care as usual (CAU). Assessments were conducted at baseline (t0), 6&#xa0;weeks after t0&#xa0;(t1), and 3&#xa0;months after t1&#xa0;(t2). General side effects (Negative and Positive Side Effects Questionnaire; NPSE) and those specific to virtual reality (VERP-Specific Side Effects Questionnaire; VEQ) were assessed at t1. Cybersickness (Simulator Sickness Questionnaire; SSQ) was assessed before and after each session. The safety evaluation involved assessing the worsening of OC-symptoms (Reliable Change Index of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale; Y&#x2011;BOCS) from t0 to t1 and serious adverse events during the intervention. Results indicated no significant clinical symptom deterioration in the VERP group and no adverse events. In total, 47% of participants in both groups experienced at least one side effect, with significantly fewer reported in the VERP than in the CAU group (p&#x202f;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).

Consequently, there is a pressing demand for efficacious management strategies.ObjectiveTo assess the comparative effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) versus vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) in improving PPPD symptoms.MethodsWe randomly assigned a cohort of 42 individuals conclusively diagnosed with PPPD to two distinct groups. The experimental group included 21 participants who received a combination of VR and optokinetic stimulation in addition to VRT, while the control group, also made up of 21 individuals, only received optokinetic stimulation in conjunction with VRT. We administered the intervention sessions twice weekly over a span of 6&#xa0;weeks, resulting in a total of 10-intervention sessions. Additionally, baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up assessments were conducted.ResultsOur analysis revealed that participants in both groups significantly improved with no significant differences between the groups.

Women in the experimental group listened to the tune of Acemashiran and watched a natural landscape with virtual reality glasses (VRG) while undergoing episiotomy repair, whereas those in the control group did not undergo any intervention during the procedure. p &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant. The results showed that the episiotomy repair time was perceived as shorter in the experimental group than in the control group.

Traditional didactic training methods often fail to provide the practical skills needed for effective safety protocol implementation. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR)-based radiation safety training with traditional didactic methods in reducing radiation exposure among medical professionals. Secondary objectives included assessing participant satisfaction, engagement and confidence in applying radiation safety practices. A 2-year randomised crossover trial was conducted with 39 medical professionals from cardiac catheterization laboratories and orthopaedic theatres. Group A received VR training in Year 1 and didactic training in Year 2, while Group B received the reverse. Radiation exposure was measured using Landauer Vision dosimeters. Participant feedback on satisfaction, engagement and confidence was collected through surveys. Data were analysed using paired t-tests, generalised estimating equations and non-parametric tests. VR training significantly reduced radiation exposure compared to didactic training, with larger effect sizes per hour of training. Group A showed significant reductions during Year 1 when they received VR training (Year 2: didactic training), while Group B exhibited similar reductions during Year 2 when they underwent VR training (Year 1: didactic training). Group A, which received VR training in Year 1 followed by didactic training in Year 2, showed significant reductions in radiation exposure during Year 1. Group B, which received didactic training in Year 1 followed by VR training in Year 2, exhibited similar reductions during Year 2.

Outcomes were mobility (Short Physical Performance Battery; continuous version; range 0-3), physical activity (average steps per day), and quality of life (EQ-5D-5L; utility score; range 0-1) measured at 6-months post-randomisation. Hypothesised mediators included mobility, physical activity, cognition, balance confidence, pain, activity and participation, and computer self-efficacy, assessed at 3-weeks post-randomisation. 216 participants with complete data were included. Three-week sit-to-stand ability mediated 6-month mobility (indirect effect 0.09 points, 95%CI 0.03-0.16), explaining 48% of the intervention's effect.

Digital rehabilitation outcomes appear to be mediated through sit-to-stand ability, dynamic single-leg-stance balance, and overall mobility. While future research is required to better understand these mediators, our findings recommend sit-to-stand training as a core element of digital rehabilitation interventions targeting mobility. Digital interventions are one option for people undergoing rehabilitation to achieve more task-specific practice in the hospital and home setting.Digital interventions aimed at improving mobility should include repetitive sit-to-stand practice, as sit-to-stand ability is a key driver of improved mobility.Digital interventions aimed at improving physical activity should include exercises that target dynamic balance, however this requires further research.Improving overall mobility should remain a key focus of using digital interventions in rehabilitation as this is a potentially important driver for improving quality of life, however this requires further research.",D006801; D008297; D005260; D000368; D011788; D000066530; D018910; D008875; D015444; D004856; D034201; D020377; D000369; D000076142,"Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Quality of Life; Neurological Rehabilitation; Video Games; Middle Aged; Exercise; Postural Balance; Computers, Handheld; Self Efficacy; Aged, 80 and over; Virtual Reality",NA,NA,NA,"Matthew A Self, Louise M N Pearce, Aidan G Cashin, Maayken E L van den Berg, Catherine Sherrington, Leanne Hassett","Sydney School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine &amp; Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.",TRUE,TRUE

Improvements can be maintained in the 3-month follow-up, except for 24-HDRS anxiety/somatization factor score, which showed significantly higher scores in the 3-month follow-up compared with postintervention (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). VR-EMDR is effective in improving depressive symptoms, traumatic experience, and cognitive performance in MDD with childhood trauma. Part of the effects can be maintained 3 months after the intervention.

This was a prospective, 4-arm, randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing inpatient head and neck surgery at a tertiary academic center from November 2021 to July 2022. Patients were randomized to Control, VR, Fitbit, or combined VR&#x2009;+&#x2009;Fitbit groups. Patients in the VR groups were brought VR headsets to use throughout each day, and patients in the Fitbit groups wore Fitbit devices and were encouraged to achieve 2,000 daily steps. The primary outcome was average daily opioid use, measured as milligram morphine equivalents (MME). There were 80 patients included.

A small pilot study was conducted among 10 patients, with VR randomized to start in the first week (""immediate VR"") versus the second week (""delayed VR"") of treatment. All patients (100%) in the immediate VR group had declines in measured distress scores after their first radiation treatment, compared to only 1 patient (16.7%) in the delayed VR group (P = .048), yet score declines generally did not meet the minimal clinically important difference threshold in the context of overall low distress scores at baseline. By day 5 of treatment, distress score changes were similar between immediate and delayed VR groups. Overall, 80% of patients in the study, including all patients with moderate or high levels of baseline anxiety/distress, reported that on-table VR improved their RT experience and/or they would recommend VR to others.

Furthermore, the study aims to evaluate individuals' tolerance levels to VR during dental scaling sessions. A randomised split-mouth design study was conducted on 29 systemically healthy adult patients aged 18&#x2009;years and above. Dental scaling was performed in two quadrants while wearing VR glasses, with the remaining quadrants undergoing the procedure without VR. The sequence of procedures was determined by random allocation. Patients were provided with VR glasses loaded with a mobile phone. After the procedure, patients were asked to complete a VR questionnaire. The primary outcome variables included pain scores with and without VR, while secondary variables included VR experience scores, baseline heart rate (HR), difference in HR, systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, difference in systolic BP, and difference in diastolic BP. All 29 subjects successfully completed the study. Paired analysis of outcome variables with and without VR glasses revealed a statistically significant difference in pain scores (two-tailed p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).

Randomized, single-blind clinical study. Twenty-eight patients with hemophilia were recruited. Patients were randomized to an experimental group (four weeks of immersive movement visualization) and a control group (no intervention). The intensity of pain, pressure pain threshold in the knee, tibialis anterior muscle, lower back level, conditioned pain modulation, range of knee motion, and lower limb functionality were evaluated. There were statistically significant differences in the intergroup effect on knee pain intensity (<i>F</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;23.71; <i>p</i>&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and lower limb functionality (<i>F</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;7.11; <i>p</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003). 42.86% of the patients in the experimental group exhibited changes greater than the minimum detectable change (MDC) in functionality. 39.29% of the patients subject to the intervention experienced changes greater than the MDC in the knee pressure pain threshold. Immersive motion visualization can improve the intensity of joint pain and functionality in patients with hemophilic knee arthropathy. Functionality, pressure pain threshold, and pain intensity improved in those patients who conducted immersive movement visualization.Implications for rehabilitationImmersive visualization of movement significantly improves intensity of joint pain, functionality, pressure pain threshold, joint health, and conditioned pain modulation in patients with hemophilic knee arthropathy.The fact that it is a therapy without potential aversive stimuli makes it a possible access pathway for patients with high levels of kinesiophobia and/or catastrophism.This low-cost, home-based technology allows its use in patients far from hemophilia reference centers or with difficult access to physiotherapy treatments.The immersive visualization of movement influences the democratization of treatment, in accordance with the WHO's Sustainable Development Goal 3 (health and well-being for all).",D006801; D016037; D008297; D006467; D000328; D007719; D016059; D010147; D005260; D055815; D008875; D017288; D016896,"Humans; Single-Blind Method; Male; Hemophilia A; Adult; Knee Joint; Range of Motion, Articular; Pain Measurement; Female; Young Adult; Middle Aged; Pain Threshold; Treatment Outcome",NA,NA,NA,"Roberto Ucero-Lozano, Elena Donoso-&#xda;beda, Rub&#xe9;n Cuesta-Barriuso, Ra&#xfa;l P&#xe9;rez-Llanes","InHeFis Research Group, Instituto Asturiano de Investigaci&#xf3;n Sanitaria (ISPA), Oviedo, Spain.",TRUE,TRUE

It can contribute to negative experiences with anesthetic induction and may cause adverse physiological and psychological effects. Virtual reality (VR) and electronic tablet devices are 2 audiovisual distraction tools that may help to reduce anxiety and enhance the preoperative experience. This study aimed to compare the use of an immersive 3-dimensional (3D) VR to 2-dimensional (2D) video on anxiety in children during induction of general anesthesia. Two hundred children (4-13 years) undergoing elective or emergency surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled in this randomized, controlled trial. Participants were randomized to use either the 3D VR goggles (intervention) or 2D video tablet (control) during anesthetic induction. Anxiety, the primary outcome, was measured using the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale Short Form (mYPAS-SF) at 2 time points: in the preoperative holding area before randomization (T1) and during induction of general anesthesia (T2). The primary outcome was analyzed using a linear regression model, including demographic and other covariates, to investigate any differences in anxiety scores. Secondary outcomes included evaluating compliance during the anesthetic induction (Induction Compliance Checklist), emergence of delirium (Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium), perceived usefulness of the device, and child satisfaction. Participant characteristics were similar between the 3D VR (n = 98) and 2D video (n = 90) groups, with a mean (&#xb1;standard deviation) age 8. 8 &#xb1; 2.8 years. The median (lower quartile, upper quartile) mYPAS-SF scores for the 3D VR group at the preoperative holding area were 22.9 (22.9, 35.4), then 29.2 (24.0, 41.7) during induction. For the 2D Video group, the scores were 27.1 (22.9, 35.4) and then 30.2 (22.9, 41.1). No significant difference was observed in the increase in mYPAS-SF scores between groups ( P = .672). Children in the 3D VR group were less likely to be rated as having a perfect induction ( P = .039). There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in emergence delirium. Both devices were rated highly for usefulness and patient satisfaction. Children preferred VR, while anesthesiologists and parents felt the 2D was more useful. This randomized controlled trial demonstrated that preoperative anxiety was equally low and induction compliance high with both 3D VR and 2D video distraction in children with parental presence during anesthetic induction.",D006801; D002648; D005260; D008297; D001007; D002675; D000293; D000768; D000076142; D014741; D016896; D002652,"Humans; Child; Female; Male; Anxiety; Child, Preschool; Adolescent; Anesthesia, General; Virtual Reality; Video Recording; Treatment Outcome; Child Behavior",9950,NA,"Conflicts of Interest, Funding: Please see DISCLOSURES at the end of this article.","Sarah Samnakay, Britta S von Ungern-Sternberg, Daisy Evans, Aine C Sommerfield, Neil D Hauser, Emily Bell, R Nazim Khan, David L Sommerfield","From the Perioperative Medicine Team, Perioperative Care Program, Telethon Kids Institute, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.",TRUE,TRUE

We hypothesized that VR in children undergoing pre-intervention TTEs decreases anxiety and fear and increases TTE study comprehensiveness and diagnostic accuracy when compared with standard distractors (television, mobile devices). Patients (6-18&#xa0;years old) scheduled for pre-intervention TTEs at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital in 2021 and 2022 were prospectively enrolled and randomized to VR and non-VR groups. Patients completed pre- and post-TTE surveys using the Children's Anxiety Meter-State (CAM-S) and Children's Fear Scale (CFS). Patients, parents, and sonographers completed post-TTE experience surveys. TTEs were reviewed by pediatric cardiologists for study comprehensiveness and compared with electronic medical records for diagnostic accuracy. Among 67 enrolled patients, 6 declined VR, 31 randomized to the VR group, and 30 to the non-VR group. Anxiety (average CAM-S difference 0.78&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.80, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0012) and fear (average CFS difference 0.36&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.74, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0005) decreased in both groups. There was no difference between groups in the change in anxiety and fear pre- and post-TTE (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.96-1.00). TTE study comprehensiveness and diagnostic accuracy were high in both groups. Procedure time (time in the echocardiography room) was less for the VR group (48.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;18.1&#xa0;min) than the non-VR group (58.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;24.4&#xa0;min), but without a statistically significant difference (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.075).

The study is a randomised controlled trial in which 28 cerebellar patients aged 7-25 yo were randomly allocated to the VR-Spirit or to a control intervention in VR. The VR-Spirit required participants to compete with different avatars in scenarios that prompted them to form predictions about avatars' intentions. The control intervention consisted of games currently adopted for motor rehabilitation. Social prediction as well as secondary neuropsychological and behavioural outcomes were assessed at the beginning (T0), at the end (T2) and after 2&#xa0;months (T3). The experimental group showed a significant increase, compared to the control participants, in social prediction assessed through a VR task. Moreover, at least at T3, the VR-Spirit enhanced the use of contextual predictions in a computer-based action prediction task. Importantly, these effects were generalized to secondary neuropsychological outcomes, specifically theory of mind and, only at T2, inhibition. No differences between the interventions were detected on emotional-behavioural problems. Lastly, both interventions showed high feasibility and acceptability. These findings confirm that it is possible to develop condition-specific rehabilitative training on the basis of neurocognitive functions impaired in case of congenital malformation. The VR-Spirit demonstrated to generalize its effects to theory of mind abilities, and it might be thus extended to other neurodevelopmental disorders that present social perception deficits and alterations of predictive processing.Trial registration: ISRCTN, ID: ISRCTN22332873.

Previously, we developed a virtual reality (VR) simulating the whole clinical treatment process of a patient with angle Class II division 1 malocclusion, and the VR also helped to explain some important orthodontic concepts. As a novel teaching tool, this study aims to compare the effects of VR versus traditional case analysis by Power Point (PPT) in inspiring student learning motivation and evaluating learning experience. A randomized, cross-over, stratified sampling method was taken to divide the fourth-year undergraduate dental students equally into two groups. The two groups were crossed over to use VR and PPT. For the whole study, results indicated that students in the VR group showed higher learning motivation (including attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction) than in the PPT group, but the differences between VR and PPT groups were not very big, and the median of the differences located at 0. For learning experience, students thought VR to be more useful, more enjoyable and more engaging, but the median of differences also located at 0. Notably, the majority of students had higher recommendations for VR than PPT, and the median difference located at 1. However, when the two phases were analysed separately, some items showed no significant differences between VR and PPT learning. VR is a very useful adjunct to education compared to traditional case analysis by PPT, but we cannot exaggerate its benefits.

The VR Sim group practiced with a VR simulation, completed a built-in treatment test and a transfer test with a live person, and was evaluated by an expert teaching assistant (TA) with a rubric. The PM Sim group practiced with a plastic manikin and completed a treatment test on the same manikin evaluated by a TA, followed by the same transfer test with a live person and evaluated by a TA with a rubric.
