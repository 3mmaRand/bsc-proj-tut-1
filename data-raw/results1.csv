Virtual reality in stroke recovery: a meta-review of systematic reviews.,"Virtual Reality (VR) is an emerging technology in post stroke recovery. However, its precise role in stroke rehabilitation is not well defined. The aim of this paper is to conduct an overview of systematic reviews on the role of VR in stroke rehabilitation. A meta-review with results from a search of 7 databases from inception till 5 th  December 2022 with subsequent quality appraisal was conducted. The primary outcome was to produce a narrative review on the efficacy of VR versus usual or other care in stroke recovery. Data was synthesized in a descriptive fashion and high-quality systematic reviews were emphasized. The AMSTAR-2 tool was used for quality assessment of the included studies. Evidence from high-quality systematic reviews suggests that there is benefit from VR in upper limb, lower limb, gait, and balance recovery particularly when additive to conventional therapy. There is also limited evidence to suggest that VR has a positive effect in those with impaired cognition. VR is safe and effective as an adjunct to conventional therapy for adults after stroke and should be used routinely for upper and lower limb motor recovery. Further high-quality studies that evaluate its efficacy and explore ways to increase its positive impact in areas such as cognition are required. There is also a scope for the development of stroke-specific virtual environments. (PROSPERO registration # CRD42022372926).",39367480,5,10,2024
Current opinion: functional dyspepsia.,"Functional dyspepsia is a common gastrointestinal disease that is under-recognized and under-diagnosed. It is a complex disorder of gut-brain interaction with no FDA-approved treatment options. The purpose of this review is to highlight updates in the proposed pathophysiology and present new data regarding potential therapies for functional dyspepsia. Alterations in the intestinal microbiome and integrity of the intestinal membrane may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of functional dyspepsia. The low FODMAP diet, in addition to modulating the microbiome with antibiotics and probiotics, are targets for large future studies. Novel methods of delivery of gut-brain therapies have shown promising results, especially virtual reality. The pathophysiology and management of functional dyspepsia is complex and there is still much unknown; however, continued research is identifying new targets for treatment. New and more targeted treatment options provide clinicians a variety of tools to offer patients with functional dyspepsia.",39360697,12,6,2024
"Impact of renality-CASE training on knowledge, skills, and practices in peritoneal dialysis catheter placement among nephrologists.","Despite being an effective home-based kidney replacement therapy, peritoneal dialysis (PD) remains underutilized. The aim of the Renality-CASE training program was to assess its impact on nephrologists by expanding their knowledge of PD therapy and enhancing their catheter placement skills to better offer the PD option. The Renality-CASE program provided two days of training, including theoretical lectures, virtual reality sessions, and hands-on practice of PD catheter placement on live pigs. Eighty-eight participants attended four sessions. An anonymized online questionnaire collected demographic data, self-assessments of knowledge and skills, and feedback. Pre- and post-training comparisons were analyzed using paired samples t-tests and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, with significance at  p  < 0.05. Fifty-seven out of 88 participants responded to the survey one-year post-training. Post-training, 94.7% felt at least moderately knowledgeable compared to 61.4% pre-training ( p  < 0.001). Confidence in skills increased to 73.6% post-training from 26% pre-training ( p  < 0.001). The number of PD catheters placed by participants also rose significantly ( p  = 0.012). The program received positive feedback and high satisfaction rates. The Renality-CASE program significantly improved nephrologists' PD catheter placement skills through comprehensive training. Despite limitations such as sample size and response bias, the study highlights the need for standardized PD training to enhance clinical practice and increase PD utilization in CKD management.",39360475,3,10,2024
Effect of tDCS combined with virtual reality for post-stroke cognitive impairment: a randomized controlled trial study protocol.,"Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) not only increases patient mortality and disability, but also adversely affects motor function and the ability to perform routine daily activities. Current therapeutic approaches for, PSCI lack specificity, primarily relying on and medication and traditional cognitive therapy supplemented by a limited array of tools. Both transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and virtual reality (VR) training have demonstrated efficacy in improving cognitive performance among PSCI patients. Previous findings across various conditions suggest that implementing a therapeutic protocol combining tDCS and VR (tDCS - VR) may yield superior in isolation. Despite this, to our knowledge, no clinical investigation combining tDCS and VR for PSCI rehabilitation has been conducted. Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore the effects of tDCS - VR on PSCI rehabilitation. This 4-week, single-center randomized clinical trial protocol will recruit 200 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four groups: Group A (tDCS + VR), Group B (tDCS + sham VR), Group C (sham tDCS + VR), Group D (sham tDCS + sham VR). All four groups will receive conventional cognitive rehabilitation training. The primary outcome measurement utilizes the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Secondary outcome measures include the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Frontal Assessment Battery, Clock Drawing Test, Digital Span Test, Logic Memory Test, and Modified Barthel Index. Additionally, S-YYZ-01 apparatus for diagnosis and treating language disorders assesses subjects' speech function. Pre- and post-four-week intervention assessments are conducted for all outcome measures. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is employed to observe changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO), deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR), and total hemoglobin (HbT) in the cerebral cortex. Our hypothesis posits that the tDCS - VR therapy, in opposed to individual tDCS or VR interventions, could enhance cognitive function, speech ability and daily living skills in PSCI patients while concurrently augmenting frontal cortical activity. This randomized study aims to provide a robust theoretical foundation supported by scientific evidence for the practical implementation of the tDCS - VR combination as a secure and efficient PSCI rehabilitation approach.

Virtual Reality Technology for Physical and Cognitive Function Rehabilitation in People With Multiple Sclerosis.,"Virtual reality (VR) has significantly expanded the possibilities of medical treatment, particularly in the realm of rehabilitation. VR utilizes advanced technologies to create simulated environments that users perceive as analogous to the real world. Researchers have demonstrated that VR can effectively train motor, sensory, and cognitive functions. This manuscript offers a concise review of recent evidence concerning the effects of VR training on key clinical symptoms in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), with the aim of highlighting VR's potential as a complementary rehabilitative tool for improving ubiquitous symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS)-a neurodegenerative, often disabling, disease. In addition to presenting a brief overview of recent literature on VR for pwMS, this narrative review seeks to provide health professionals with a foundational understanding of VR as a rehabilitative tool in MS. Furthermore, it may aid in identifying gaps in the literature and stimulate the development of new hypotheses and theories regarding the use of VR in patients with a neurodegenerative disease.",39355707,24,9,2024
Efficacy of virtual reality therapy versus pharmacological sedation for reducing pain and anxiety during coronary catheterisation procedures: A prospective randomised controlled trial.,"The use of virtual reality (VR) therapy has grown considerably, as it is effective for reducing pain and anxiety in different clinical areas. However, it has not been well evaluated for coronary angiography and angioplasty. This study aimed to compare VR therapy with pharmacological sedation (Sedation) for reducing pain in patients undergoing a planned coronary angiography or coronary/peripheral angioplasty. In this prospective randomized controlled trial, patients were randomly allocated to one of two groups before catheterization: a Sedation group (injection of midazolam and fentanyl) or a VR group (Deepsen VR headset). The primary outcome measure was the maximum pain during the procedure (visual analogue scale: 0-10). The secondary outcome measures were anxiety following the procedure (Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory: 20-80), the occurrence of arterial spasm, the haemodynamic profile and patient satisfaction. The VR group ( n  = 63) had a mean pain rating of 2.5; for the Sedation group ( n  = 59) this was 1.0. This did not meet the criterion for non-inferiority. Anxiety was comparable between the two groups (VR: 25.4; Sedation: 24.7), as was the occurrence of arterial spasm (VR: 7.9%; Sedation: 8.5%;  p  = 0.91), but blood pressure was higher in the VR group (140.2/71.7 mmHg vs. 121.8/64.7 mmHg). There were no VR-related adverse effects, and patient satisfaction was high for both groups. Virtual reality therapy was not non-inferior to pharmacological sedation for reducing pain during coronary angiography or angioplasty. However, it reduced anxiety to a comparable level. Virtual reality therapy represents an alternative to pharmacological sedation, which is well accepted by patients.",39355099,30,9,2024
An Ensemble Learning Algorithm for Cognitive Evaluation by an Immersive Virtual Reality Supermarket.,"Early screening for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is crucial in delaying cognitive deterioration and treating dementia. Conventional neuropsychological tests, commonly used for MCI detection, often lack ecological validity due to their simplistic and quiet testing environments. To address this gap, our study developed an immersive VR supermarket cognitive assessment program (IVRSCAP), simulating daily cognitive activities to enhance the ecological validity of MCI detection. This program involved elderly participants from Chengdu Second People's Hospital and various communities, comprising both MCI patients (N=301) and healthy elderly individuals (N=1027). They engaged in the VR supermarket cognitive test, generating complex datasets including User Behavior Data, Tested Cognitive Dimension Game Data, Trajectory Data, and Regional Data. To analyze this data, we introduced an adaptive ensemble learning method for imbalanced samples. Our study's primary contribution is demonstrating the superior performance of this algorithm in classifying MCI and healthy groups based on their performance in IVRSCAP. Comparative analysis confirmed its efficacy over traditional imbalanced sample processing methods and classic ensemble learning voting algorithms, significantly outperforming in metrics such as recall, F1-score, AUC, and G-mean. Our findings advocate the combined use of IVRSCAP and our algorithm as a technologically advanced, ecologically valid approach for enhancing early MCI detection strategies. This aligns with our broader aim of integrating realistic simulations with advanced computational techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy in cognitive health assessments.",39348261,30,9,2024
An In Vivo Study to Evaluate and Compare Anxiety and Behavior Management of Pediatric Patients Using Distraction Techniques.,"To compare the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) glasses and on-screen distraction techniques in managing anxiety and behavior in children receiving dental treatments. Forty patients aged 4-8 years requiring restoration were divided into two groups: group I with 20 members using audio-visual distraction aid in the form of VR glasses and group II with 20 participants utilizing on-screen distraction techniques. Each child underwent two appointments one week apart; their anxiety and behavior levels were assessed at each visit using the Facial Image Scale and Frankel's Behavior rating scale. The Wilcoxon signed-rank and Chi-squared test were utilized to assess the correlation between two categorical variables, with VR demonstrating a notable divergence from on-screen distraction. Both on-screen distraction and VR applications decreased anxiety levels and improved behavior. However, VR was substantially more effective in managing these areas.",39346360,3,4,2024
Acute Augmented Effect of Virtual Reality (VR)-Integrated Relaxation and Mindfulness Exercising on Anxiety and Insomnia Symptoms: A Retrospective Analysis of 103 Anxiety Disorder Patients With Prominent Insomnia.,"Anxiety disorder is one of the most common mental disorders and often accompanied with sleep disturbance which can in turn exacerbate anxiety symptoms, creating a vicious cycle. In addition to psychopharmacological therapy, the effectiveness of psychotherapy as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for treating anxiety disorders and insomnia has been well documented and widely accepted, but it is labor-intensive and costly. However, virtual reality (VR)-integrated CBT may improve this condition but needs more evidences to support its extensive application in routine clinical practice. This explorative study was aimed to conduct a retrospective analysis to evaluate the acute (2 weeks) augmented effect of VR-integrated relaxation and mindfulness exercising in improving anxiety and insomnia symptoms for patients who were diagnosed with anxiety disorders and concurrently with prominent insomnia symptoms and admitted to the Department of Psychiatry, The Affiliated Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital of Jinan University during January 2021 to June 2021. All patients who were admitted to the department of psychiatry during January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021 were screened with inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria, and the sociodemographic and clinical data of those included patients were collected from the electronic medical record system of the hospital using a self-designed case report form (CRF). Subjects who were administrated with medication alone were designated as conventional group, and those receiving treatment of medication combined with VR-integrated CBT (VR relaxation and mindfulness exercising) as VR group. The baseline and 2-week posttreatment data were compared between the two groups. In total, there were 103 patients (70 female, 68%) included in the study. Among all, 68 (66.02%) were designated as the ""VR group,"" and 35 (33.98%) as the ""conventional group."" The majority of patients (67%) were diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Twenty-three (22.3%) patients had a comorbid diagnosis with primary insomnia, and insomnia was just one of the accompanying symptoms with anxiety for the rest 80 subjects. No statistically significant differences were found between VR and conventional groups in all baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics except for occupation. There were statistically significant differences for the remission rates of anxiety symptoms or insomnia symptoms and reduction of Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale or Insomnia Severity Index total scores between conventional and VR groups. Greater remission rates or score reductions were found in VR group than in conventional group either for anxiety or for insomnia. Robust differences still existed when controlled for the variable ""occupation."" Two-week augmented VR-integrated relaxation and mindfulness exercising is acutely beneficial for relieving both anxiety and insomnia symptoms and worth being recommended for routine clinical practice. Further prospective and randomized study compared to traditional CBT to explore its acute and long-term effect on anxiety and insomnia is needed.",39344370,NA,NA,NA
Gamified Practice Improves Paretic Arm Motor Behavior in Individuals With Stroke.,"Stroke is a heterogeneous condition, making choice of treatment, and determination of how to structure rehabilitation outcomes diﬃcult. Individualized goal-directed and repetitive physical practice is an important determinant of motor learning. Yet, many investigations of motor learning after stroke deliver task practice without consideration of individual capability of the learner. We developed a gamified arm rehabilitation task for people with stroke that is personalized to individual capacity for paretic arm movement, provides a high dose of practice, progresses through increasingly difficulty levels that are dependent on the performance of the individual, and is practiced in an engaging environment. The objectives of the current study were to determine if 10 days of gamified, object intercept training using the paretic arm would improve arm movement speed and clinical outcome measures of impairment or function. Individuals with chronic stroke and age-matched controls engaged in 10 days of gamified, skilled motor practice of a semi-immersive virtual reality-based intercept and release task. The paretic arm was assessed using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (motor impairment) and Wolf Motor Function Test (motor function) before and after training. Both groups showed faster arm movement speed with practice; individuals with stroke demonstrated reduced paretic arm motor impairment and increased function after the intervention. Age and sex (for both groups), and time post-stroke were not related to changes in movement speed. Findings indicate that gamified motor training positively affects paretic arm motor behavior in individuals with mild to severe chronic stroke.",39342450,28,9,2024
Effects of a 6-week treadmill training with and without virtual reality on frailty in people with multiple sclerosis: Frailty rehabilitation in multiple sclerosis.,"To examine the effects of a cognitive-motor rehabilitation program consisting of treadmill training augmented by virtual reality (TT+VR) on frailty in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). Secondary analysis from a multi-center randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of TT+VR, compared to treadmill training (TT) only, on measures of mobility and cognitive function in pwMS. Four university research laboratories in Israel, the United States, and Germany. A total of 124 pwMS were randomized into the parent trial. Here, we studied a subset of 83 participants (mean age=49.4±9.3 years, 73.5% female, EDSS range=2.0-6.0), who completed the intervention and had complete pre- and post-intervention frailty data. Participants were randomly allocated to TT+VR (n=44) or to TT (n=39). Both groups trained three times a week for six weeks. Frailty was assessed using a 40-item frailty index (FI) through standard validated procedures and represented the primary study outcome. Two exploratory frailty indices were also computed by isolating health-related deficits involving the cognitive (FI-physical) or physical (FI-cognitive) domains from the main FI. The assessments were performed at baseline and after six weeks, upon intervention completion. The mean FI of study participants at baseline was 0.33±0.13, indicating a moderate average level of frailty. FI scores improved in both TT+VR and TT participants (pooled mean ΔFI=0.024, 95%CI=0.010-0.038, F=10.49, p=0.002, η p 2 =0.115), without any group-by-time interaction (F=0.82, p=0.367, η p 2 =0.010). However, a significant group-by-time interaction was found for pre- and post-training changes in FI-cognitive (F=5.74, p=0.019, η p 2 =0.066), suggesting a greater improvement for TT+VR participants than for TT participants. Treadmill training with or without virtual reality can reduce frailty levels in pwMS. While both TT and TT+VR had a positive impact on overall frailty, only TT+VR improved cognitive aspects of frailty and may represent an appropriate strategy for counteracting frailty in pwMS.",39341443,26,9,2024
Virtual Reality in Cancer Care: Enhancing Knowledge and Reducing Anxiety about Chemotherapy among Patients and Caregivers.,"Virtual reality (VR) technology has evolved from entertainment to significant applications in healthcare and education. Despite its potential, there is limited research on the role of VR in cancer care. This study investigates VR's ability to simulate the chemotherapy process, aiming to enhance patients' knowledge and mitigate anxiety associated with chemotherapy. Utilizing a two-arm, mixed-methods pre/post-survey design, the study measured changes in patients' anxiety and knowledge before and after exposure to a VR simulation. Participants ( n  = 267) engaged with VR simulations or interactive 360-degree videos depicting the chemotherapy process. Data analyses revealed a significant median increase in chemotherapy knowledge post-exposure to the VR content (z = 12.511,  p  < 0.001). Demographic factSors significantly influenced perceptions of VR realism and usefulness ( p  < 0.05). Additionally, VR exposure was correlated with reduced anxiety levels and improved treatment expectations ( p  < 0.05). Participants with higher post-understanding chemotherapy scores considered VR a useful tool for managing anxiety about chemotherapy and recommended VR for other medical procedures ( p  < 0.001). These findings underscore VR technology's potential as a valuable tool in cancer treatment, suggesting it can enhance patient education and reduce anxiety, thereby improving patient outcomes during cancer therapy.",39338046,1,9,2024
Virtual Reality as a Therapeutic Tool in Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation: A Comprehensive Evaluation and Systematic Review.,"Introduction : The spinal rehabilitation process plays a crucial role in SCI patients' lives, and recent developments in VR have the potential to efficiently engage SCI patients in therapeutic activities and promote neuroplasticity.  Objective : The primary objective of this study is to assess a complete review of the extended impacts of VR-assisted training on spine rehabilitation in SCI patients.  Methods : This systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) through a single database search in PubMed/Medline between the dates 1 January 2010 and 1 February 2024.

Results : The search produced 257 articles, and 46 of them were allocated for data extraction to evaluate 652 patients. Both when VR training was analyzed and reviewed separately, and when compared to traditional training, the findings exhibited predominantly promising outcomes, reflecting a favorable trend in the study. VR technologies were used in different settings and customizations, and the medium total time of VR training among the studies was 60.46 h per patient.  Conclusions : This auspicious outcome of the study further motivates the intervention of VR and AR in the rehabilitation of SCI patients along with ameliorating their overall holistic well-being.",39336916,13,9,2024
Effectiveness of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) during a Virtual Reality Task in Women with Fibromyalgia-A Randomized Clinical Study.,"Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and impaired motor performance. This study aimed to investigate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) during virtual reality (VR) tasks on the motor performance of women with FM. Participants were divided into two groups: Group A received active tDCS for 10 days followed by sham tDCS for 10 days, while Group B received the opposite sequence. Both groups performed VR tasks using MoveHero software (v. 2.4) during the tDCS sessions. Motor performance was assessed by the number of hits (movement with correct timing to reach the targets) and absolute (accuracy measure) and variable (precision measure) errors during VR tasks. Participants were 21 women, aged 30-50 years, and diagnosed with FM. Group A, which received active tDCS first, presented significant improvements in motor performance (number of hits and absolute and variable errors). The benefits of active tDCS persisted into the sham phase, suggesting a lasting neuroplastic effect. tDCS during VR tasks significantly improved motor performance in women with FM, particularly in complex, extensive movements. These findings indicate that tDCS enhances neuroplasticity, leading to sustained motor improvements, making it a promising therapeutic tool in FM rehabilitation.",39335423,18,9,2024
Comparison between Motor Performance of People with Multiple Sclerosis during a Virtual Reality Task Practiced on Concrete and Abstract Devices: A Cross-Sectional Randomized Study.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with unknown etiology, resulting in various impairments that necessitate continuous rehabilitation to enhance functionality, quality of life, and motor function, including through Virtual Reality (VR) therapy. Comparing tasks in virtual environments and their potential skill transfer to real-world settings could aid in optimizing treatment programs to improve motor performance in individuals with MS. This study aimed to determine whether practicing acquisition and retention phases using two distinct interfaces (concrete-Touch Screen or abstract-Kinect system) affects performance in a subsequent task using a different interface (transfer phase). A randomized clinical trial was conducted with 56 volunteers with MS and 41 controls. Participants engaged in a computer game where they burst as many bubbles as possible within 10 s per attempt. After the acquisition and retention phases, all participants switched interfaces (e.g., those using Kinect switched to Touchscreen and vice versa). Significant performance improvements were observed in both groups during the acquisition phase, which were maintained in the retention phase. Although the abstract interface was more challenging for both groups, only the MS group that practiced with the abstract interface successfully transferred their improvements to the concrete interface. Thus, despite the increased difficulty of the abstract task during practice, it led to better performance transfer when required to complete a subsequent concrete task, suggesting that abstract devices may be beneficial in clinical practice for improving motor function in people with MS.",39335411,12,9,2024
Efficacy of a Virtual Reality Rehabilitation Protocol Based on Art Therapy in Patients with Stroke: A Single-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Art therapy has a long history of applications in cognitive and motor rehabilitation. More recently, a growing body of scientific literature has highlighted the potential of virtual reality in neurorehabilitation, though it has focused more on the technology itself than on the principles adopted in digital scenarios. This study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial conducted on 40 patients with stroke, comparing conventional therapy (physical therapy for the upper and lower limbs, for posture and balance, cognitive therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and specific therapy for swallowing, bowel, and bladder dysfunctions) to a protocol in which the upper limb physical therapy was substituted with art therapy administered by means of virtual reality exploiting the so-called Michelangelo effect. After 12 sessions, patients in the virtual art therapy group showed a significantly greater improvement in independence in activities of daily living, as assessed by the Barthel Index (interaction of time and group:  p  = 0.001). Significant differences were also found in terms of upper limb muscle strength (Manual Muscle Test,  p  < 0.01) and reduction in spasticity (Ashworth scale,  p  = 0.007) in favor of the experimental group. In the virtual art therapy group, the effectiveness of the intervention was significantly correlated with patient participation (Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale: R = 0.41), patient satisfaction (R = 0.60), and the perceived utility of the intervention by the therapist (R = 0.43). These findings support the efficacy of virtual art therapy leveraging the Michelangelo effect. Further studies should also focus on cognitive domains that could benefit from this type of approach.",39335359,27,8,2024
A Virtual Reality Platform for Evaluating Deficits in Executive Functions in Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children-Relation to Daily Function and to Quality of Life.,"Background:  Childhood hearing loss is a common chronic condition that may have a broad impact on children's communication and motor and cognitive development, resulting in functional challenges and decreased quality of life (QoL).  Objectives:  This pilot study aimed to compare executive functions (EFs) as expressed in daily life and QoL between deaf and hard-of-hearing (D/HH) children and children with typical hearing. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between EFs and QoL in D/HH children.  Methods:  The participants were 76 children aged 7-11 yr: 38 D/HH and 38 with typical hearing. Parents completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), while the child performed a shopping task in the virtual action planning supermarket (VAP-S) to reflect the use of EFs in daily activity.  Results:  D/HH children showed significantly poorer EFs (as measured by BRIEF and VAP-S) and reduced QoL. Difficulties in EFs were correlated with lower QoL. BRIEF scores were significant predictors of QoL domains.  Conclusions:  Difficulties in EFs may characterize children with D/HH and reduce their QoL. Therefore, EFs should be screened and treated. VAP-S and BRIEF are feasible tools for evaluating EFs that reflect children's challenges due to EF difficulties in real-life contexts.",39334655,13,9,2024

The included studies encompass diverse digital interventions, platforms, and modalities used across various mental health conditions. The review identifies feasible, acceptable, and efficacious interventions, ranging from telehealth and mobile apps to virtual reality and machine learning models. Opportunities for improving access to care, reducing patients' transfers, and utilizing real-world interaction data for symptom monitoring are highlighted. However, challenges such as digital exclusion, privacy concerns, and potential service replacement caution policymakers. This study serves as a valuable evidence base for policymakers and mental health stakeholders in the UAE to navigate the integration of digital technology in mental health services effectively.",39334131,27,9,2024
Redesign of a virtual reality basic life support module for medical training - a feasibility study.,"Healthcare providers, including medical students, should maintain their basic life support (BLS) skills and be able to perform BLS in case of cardiac arrest. Research shows that the use of virtual reality (VR) has advantages such as improved accessibility, practice with lifelike situations, and real-time feedback during individual training sessions. A VR BLS module incorporating these advantages, called Virtual Life Support, has been developed especially for the medical domain. Virtual Life Support was collaboratively developed by software developers and stakeholders within the field of medical education. For this study, we explored whether the first version of this module capitalised on the advantages of VR and aimed to develop an understanding of barriers to feasibility of use. This study was conducted to assess the feasibility of employing Virtual Life Support for medical training and pinpoint potential obstacles. Four groups of stakeholders were included through purposive sampling: physicians, BLS instructors, educational experts, and medical students. Participants performed BLS on a BLS mannequin while using Virtual Life Support and were interviewed directly afterwards using semi-structured questions. The data was coded and analysed using thematic analysis. Thematic saturation was reached after seventeen interviews were conducted. The codes were categorised into four themes: introduction, content, applicability, and acceptability/tolerability. Sixteen barriers for the use of Virtual Life Support were found and subsequently categorised into must-have (restraining function, i.e. necessary to address) and nice to have features (non-essential elements to consider addressing). The study offers valuable insights into redesigning Virtual Life Support for Basic Life Support training, specifically tailored for medical students and healthcare providers, using a primarily qualitative approach. The findings suggest that the benefits of virtual reality, such as enhanced realism and immersive learning, can be effectively integrated into a single training module. Further development and validation of VR BLS modules, such as the one evaluated in this study, have the potential to revolutionise BLS training. This could significantly improve both the quality of skills and the accessibility of training, ultimately enhancing preparedness for real-life emergency scenarios.",39333990,27,9,2024
"Examining the Feasibility, Acceptability, and Preliminary Efficacy of an Immersive Virtual Reality-Assisted Lower Limb Strength Training for Knee Osteoarthritis: Mixed Methods Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.","Knee osteoarthritis prevalently causes significant pain, activity limitations, psychological distress, and reduced quality of life. Despite lower limb strength training being a core treatment for knee osteoarthritis, adherence remains a challenge, prompting the exploration of virtual reality (VR) to improve exercise compliance. Recent research suggests the potential of VR in providing enhanced pain management and functional outcomes for knee osteoarthritis, necessitating further exploration of immersive VR technology. We aimed to study the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an immersive VR-assisted lower limb strength training for knee osteoarthritis (VRiKnee). A convergent, parallel, mixed methods study was conducted in 30 participants with knee osteoarthritis. After 1:1 randomization, the VRiKnee group (n=15) was assigned to perform repetitive concentric quadriceps and isometric vastus medialis oblique exercise in an immersive environment using a head-mounted display for 12 weeks. The control group (n=15) completed the same exercises without VRiKnee. VRiKnee participants were interviewed at week 12 to study VRiKnee acceptability and user experience. Quantitative data included feasibility outcomes such as recruitment, dropout, and exercise adherence rates, and effectiveness outcomes such as the numeric rating scale, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (100 points) pain and function subscales, and objective physical activity measured by metabolic equivalents of task using an ActivPAL accelerometer. Qualitative data were analyzed by thematic analysis, followed by integration with quantitative data using joint displays. The recruitment rate was 100% (N=30), with enrollment of 30 participants in 7.57 weeks. The median age was 63.5 (IQR 61.8-66.3) years, with 76% (n=23) being female. The response rates were 80% and 93% for the VRiKnee and control groups. Dropout rates were 13% for VRiKnee and 7% for the control group. Median exercise adherence was 77% (IQR 37-104%) for VRiKnee and 62% (IQR 40-166%) for the control group, respectively, with adherence reduction over this study's period and no significant intergroup differences (P=.82). No statistically significant differences were observed in primary and secondary outcomes, though positive trends were observed in pain and stiffness. Cybersickness was reported by 5 (33%) participants in the VRiKnee group. In the qualitative analysis, 4 themes, 11 subthemes, and 16 quotes were generated, identifying facilitators and barriers with practical suggestions to enhance the usability of VRiKnee. VRiKnee demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy in managing knee osteoarthritis. Future trials of larger sample sizes and better VR designs will confirm its role in clinical practice.",39331525,27,9,2024
Altered Movement Coordination during Functional Reach Tasks in Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain and Its Relationship to Numerical Pain Rating Scores.,"Identifying the effects of pain catastrophizing on movement patterns in people with chronic low back pain (CLBP) has important clinical implications for treatment approaches. Prior research has shown people with CLBP have decreased lumbar-hip ratios during trunk flexion movements, indicating a decrease in the contribution of lumbar flexion relative to hip flexion during trunk flexion. In this study, we aim to explore the relationship between pain catastrophizing and movement patterns during trunk flexion in a CLBP population. Participants with CLBP (N = 98, male = 59, age = 39.1 ± 13.0) completed a virtual reality standardized reaching task that necessitated a progressively larger amount of trunk flexion. Specifically, participants reached for four virtual targets to elicit 15°, 30°, 45°, and 60° trunk flexion in the mid-sagittal plane. Lumbar flexion was derived from the motion data. Self-report measures of numerical pain ratings, kinesiophobia, and pain catastrophizing were obtained. Pain catastrophizing leads to decreased lumbar flexion angles during forward reaching. This effect is greater in females than males.",39330445,12,9,2024
Beyond Pharmacology: A Narrative Review of Alternative Therapies for Anxiety Disorders.,"Anxiety disorders significantly reduce patients' quality of life. Current pharmacological treatments, primarily benzodiazepines and antidepressants, are associated with numerous side effects. Consequently, there is a continual search for alternative methods to traditional therapies that are less burdensome for patients and broaden their therapeutic options. Our objective was to determine the role of selected alternative methods in the treatment of anxiety disorders. In this review, we examined recent evidence on alternative treatments for anxiety disorders, including physical activity, mindfulness, virtual reality (VR) technology, biofeedback, herbal remedies, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), cryotherapy, hyperbaric therapy, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy. For this purpose we reviewed PubMed and after initial search, we excluded works unrelated to our aim, non-orginal data and animal studies. We conducted second search to cover all minor methods. We included 116 studies, which data is presented in Tables. We have investigated which methods can support treatment and which can be used as a stand-alone treatment. We assessed the risks to benefits of using alternative treatments. Alternative treatments significantly expand the options available to patients and clinicians, with many serving as adjuncts to traditional therapies. Among the methods presented, mindfulness has the most significant therapeutic potential.",39329885,16,9,2024

Exergaming for dementia and mild cognitive impairment.,"Dementia and mild cognitive impairment are significant contributors to disability and dependency in older adults. Current treatments for managing these conditions are limited. Exergaming, a novel technology-driven intervention combining physical exercise with cognitive tasks, is a potential therapeutic approach. To assess the effects of exergaming interventions on physical and cognitive outcomes, and activities of daily living, in people with dementia and mild cognitive impairment. On 22 December 2023, we searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO (World Health Organization) meta-register the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited individuals diagnosed with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Exergaming interventions involved participants being engaged in physical activity of at least moderate intensity, and used immersive and non-immersive virtual reality (VR) technology and real-time interaction. We planned to classify comparators as inactive control group (e.g. no treatment, waiting list), active control group (e.g. standard treatment, non-specific active control), or alternative treatment (e.g. physical activity, computerised cognitive training). Outcomes were to be measured using validated instruments. Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool RoB 2, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We consulted a third author if required. Where possible, we pooled outcome data using a fixed-effect or random-effects model. We expressed treatment effects as standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes and as risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). When data could not be pooled, we presented a narrative synthesis. We included 11 studies published between 2014 and 2023. Six of these studies were pre-registered. Seven studies involved 308 participants with mild cognitive impairment, and five studies included 228 individuals with dementia. One of the studies presented data for both MCI and dementia separately. Most comparisons exhibited a high risk or some concerns of bias. We have only low or very low certainty about all the results presented below. Effects of exergaming interventions for people with dementia Compared to a control group Exergaming may improve global cognitive functioning at the end of treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain (SMD 1.47, 95% 1.04 to 1.90; 2 studies, 113 participants). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of exergaming at the end of treatment on global physical functioning (SMD -0.20, 95% -0.57 to 0.17; 2 studies, 113 participants) or activities of daily living (ADL) (SMD -0.28, 95% -0.65 to 0.09; 2 studies, 113 participants). The evidence is very uncertain about adverse effects due to the small sample size and no events. Findings are based on two studies (113 participants), but data could not be pooled; both studies reported no adverse reactions linked to the intervention or control group. Compared to an alternative treatment group At the end of treatment, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of exergaming on global physical functioning (SMD 0.14, 95% -0.30 to 0.58; 2 studies, 85 participants) or global cognitive functioning (SMD 0.11, 95% -0.33 to 0.55; 2 studies, 85 participants). For ADL, only one study was available (n = 67), which provided low-certainty evidence of little to no difference between exergaming and exercise. The evidence is very uncertain about adverse effects of exergaming compared with alternative treatment (RR 7.50, 95% CI 0.41 to 136.52; 2 studies, 2/85 participants). Effects of exergaming interventions for people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) Compared to a control group Exergaming may improve global cognitive functioning at the end of treatment for people with MCI, but the evidence is very uncertain, (SMD 0.79, 95% 0.05 to 1.53; 2 studies, 34 participants). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of exergaming at the end of treatment on global physical functioning (SMD 0.27, 95% -0.41 to 0.94; 2 studies, 34 participants) and ADL (SMD 0.51, 95% -0.01 to 1.03; 2 studies, 60 participants). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of exergaming on adverse effects due to a small sample size and no events (0/14 participants). Findings are based on one study. Compared to an alternative treatment group The evidence is very uncertain about global physical functioning at the end of treatment. Only one study was included (n = 45). For global cognitive functioning, we included four studies (n = 235 participants), but due to considerable heterogeneity (I² = 96%), we could not pool results. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of exergaming on global cognitive functioning. No study evaluated ADL outcomes. The evidence is very uncertain about adverse effects of exergaming due to the small sample size and no events (n = 123 participants). Findings are based on one study. Overall, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of exergaming on global physical and cognitive functioning, and ADL. There may be an improvement in global cognitive functioning at the end of treatment for both people with dementia and people with MCI, but the evidence is very uncertain. The potential benefit is observed only when exergaming is compared with a control intervention (e.g. usual care, listening to music, health education), and not when compared with an alternative treatment with a specific effect, such as physical activity (e.g. standing and sitting exercises or cycling). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of exergaming on adverse effects. All sessions took place in a controlled and supervised environment. Therefore, we do not know if exergaming can be safely used in a home environment, unsupervised.",39319863,25,9,2024
Neuroanatomical photogrammetric models using smartphones: a comparison of apps.,"A deep knowledge of the surgical anatomy of the target area is mandatory for a successful operative procedure. For this purpose, over the years, many teaching and learning methods have been described, from the most ancient cadaveric dissection to the most recent virtual reality, each with their respective pros and cons. Photogrammetry, an emergent technique, allows for the creation of three-dimensional (3D) models and reconstructions. Thanks to the spreading of photogrammetry nowadays it is possible to generate these models using professional software or even smartphone apps. This study aims to compare the neuroanatomical photogrammetric models generated by the two most utilized smartphone applications in this domain, Metascan and 3D-Scanner, through quantitative analysis. Two human head specimens (four sides) were examined. Anatomical dissection was segmented into five stages to systematically expose well-defined structures. After each stage, a photogrammetric model was generated using two prominent smartphone applications. These models were then subjected to both quantitative and qualitative analysis, with a specific focus on comparing the mesh density as a measure of model resolution and accuracy. Appropriate consent was obtained for the publication of the cadaver's image. The quantitative analysis revealed that the models generated by Metascan app consistently demonstrated superior mesh density compared to those from 3D-Scanner, indicating a higher level of detail and potential for precise anatomical representation. Enabling depth perception, capturing high-quality images, offering flexibility in viewpoints: photogrammetry provides researchers with unprecedented opportunities to explore and understand the intricate and magnificent structure of the brain. However, it is of paramount importance to develop and apply rigorous quality control systems to ensure data integrity and reliability of findings in neurological research. This study has demonstrated the superiority of Metascan in processing photogrammetric models for neuroanatomical studies.",39316122,24,9,2024
3D Slicer combined with neuroendoscopic surgery for the treatment of basal ganglia hemorrhage after cranioplasty: A case report and literature review.,"The minimally invasive surgery through transcranial endoscopic keyhole approach has become the main surgical method for treating cerebral hemorrhage. This method has the advantages of small trauma, short surgical time, low bleeding volume, and fast postoperative recovery. However, this method is not suitable for cases where cerebral hemorrhage occurs again after skull repair surgery. Our team used 3D Slicer reconstruction combined with virtual reality technology to find a suitable keyhole surgical approach and successfully completed a neuroendoscopic removal of basal ganglia hemorrhage through the eyebrow arch keyhole approach in a case of recurrent cerebral hemorrhage after cranioplasty.",39315130,13,9,2024
Knowledge mapping of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease: a bibliometric analysis.,"Among the disturbing motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), freezing of gait (FOG) stands out as one of the most severe challenges. It typically arises during the initiation of gait or when turning. This phenomenon not only impose a heavy burden on patients, but also on their families. We conduct a bibliometric analysis to summarize current research hotspots and trends concerning freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease (PD-FOG) over past two decades. We retrieved articles and reviews published in English about PD-FOG in the Web of science Core Collection database from 2000 to 2023 on November 30,2023. The tools VOSviewer and CiteSpace facilitated a visual analysis covering various aspects such as publications, countries/regions, organizations, authors, journals, cited references, and keywords. This study includes 1,340 articles from 64 countries/regions. There is a growth in publications related to PD-FOG over the past two decades, maintaining a stable high output since 2018, indicating a promising research landscape in the field of PD-FOG. The United States holds a leading position in this field, with Nieuwboer A and Giladi N being two of the most influential researchers. Over the past two decades, the research hotspots for PD-FOG have primarily encompassed the kinematic characteristics, diagnosis and detection, cognitive deficits and neural connectivity, as well as therapy and rehabilitation of PD-FOG. Topics including functional connectivity, virtual reality, deep learning and machine learning will be focal points of future research. This is the first bibliometric analysis of PD-FOG. We construct this study to summarize the research in this field over past two decades, visually show the current hotspots and trends, and offer scholars in this field concepts and strategies for subsequent studies.",39315077,9,9,2024
Human centered design of AI-powered Digital Therapeutics for stress prevention: Perspectives from multi-stakeholders' workshops about the SHIVA solution.,"AI-powered Digital Therapeutics (DTx) hold potential for enhancing stress prevention by promoting the scalability of P5 Medicine, which may offer users coping skills and improved self-management of mental wellbeing. However, adoption rates remain low, often due to insufficient user and stakeholder involvement during the design phases. This study explores the human-centered design potentials of SHIVA, a DTx integrating virtual reality and AI with the SelfHelp+ intervention, aiming to understand stakeholder views and expectations that could influence its adoption. Using the SHIVA example, we detail design opportunities involving AI techniques for stress prevention across modeling, personalization, monitoring, and simulation dimensions. Workshops with 12 stakeholders-including target users, digital health designers, and mental health experts-addressed four key adoption aspects through peer interviews: AI data processing, wearable device roles, deployment scenarios, and the model's transparency, explainability, and accuracy. Stakeholders perceived AI-based data processing as beneficial for personalized treatment in a secure, privacy-preserving environment. While wearables were deemed essential, concerns about compulsory use and VR headset costs were noted. Initial human facilitation was favored to enhance engagement and prevent dropouts. Transparency, explainability, and accuracy were highlighted as crucial for the stress detection model. Stakeholders recognized AI-driven opportunities as crucial for SHIVA's adoption, facilitating personalized solutions tailored to user needs. Nonetheless, challenges persist in developing a transparent, explainable, and accurate stress detection model to ensure user engagement, adherence, and trust.",39314669,14,9,2024
Extended Reality in Revolutionizing Neurological Disease: A New Era for Chronic Condition Treatment.,"Extended reality (XR), which includes virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR), provides promising advancements in managing chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. This review examines the impact of XR technologies on neurological care, highlighting their ability to create immersive, interactive environments that enhance rehabilitation through tailored motor and cognitive exercises. XR supports neuroplasticity by providing engaging, contextually relevant exercises and real-time feedback, offering innovative alternatives to traditional methods. The technical issues, clinical validation, and accessibility must be addressed despite the potential benefits. Future developments should focus on refining XR applications, integrating them with complementary technologies, and establishing robust policies to guide their effective and ethical use. XR is poised to revolutionize neurological rehabilitation, promising improved patient outcomes and transforming medical training.",39314602,23,8,2024
Implementation of a Virtual Reality Intervention in Outpatient Physiotherapy for Chronic Pain: Protocol for a Pilot Implementation Study.,"Chronic pain is a global health issue that causes physical, psychological, and social disabilities for patients, as well as high costs for societies. Virtual reality (VR) is a new treatment that provides an opportunity to narrow the gap between clinical practice and recommended care in the use of patient education and behavioral interventions in the outpatient physiotherapy setting. However, there is currently no implementation strategy to integrate VR treatments into this setting. This protocol outlines a pilot implementation study that aims to (1) identify barriers and facilitators for implementing a VR intervention in outpatient physiotherapy care for people with chronic pain and (2) develop and pilot test an implementation strategy in 5 practices in Germany. The study consists of 4 phases. The first phase involves adapting the treatment protocol of the VR intervention to the local context of outpatient physiotherapy practices in Germany. The second phase includes the collection of barriers and facilitators through semistructured interviews from physiotherapists and the development of a theory-driven implementation strategy based on the Theoretical Domains framework and the Behavior Change Wheel. This strategy will be applied in the third phase, which will also include a 6-month span of using VR interventions in practices, along with a process evaluation. The fourth phase consists of semistructured interviews to evaluate the developed implementation strategy. The recruitment process and phase 1, including the adaptation of the treatment protocol, have already been completed. We recruited 5 physiotherapy practices in Lower Saxony, Germany, where the VR intervention will be implemented. The collection of barriers and facilitators through semistructured interviews is scheduled to begin in February 2024. This pilot implementation study aims to develop a theory-driven implementation strategy for integrating a VR intervention into outpatient physiotherapy care for people with chronic pain. The identified barriers and facilitators, along with the implementation strategy, will serve as a starting point for future randomized controlled implementation studies in different settings to refine the implementation process and integrate VR interventions into the outpatient care of people with chronic pain.

The IntegraPark Study: An Opportunity to Facilitate High-Intensity Exercise with Immersive Virtual Reality in Parkinson's Disease Patients.,"high-intensity exercise is a feasible and effective modality in the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there are only a few studies that have carried out this type of intervention in customizable immersive virtual reality (IVR) environments. We explore the feasibility and effects of IVR-based high-intensity training through rowing and cycling exercises on the functional capacity, quality of life, and progression of PD. a total of 12 participants (61.50 ± 10.49 years old; 41.7% female, 58.3% male; stages I-III) were part of the study, which consisted of interventions of rowing and cycling in an IVR commercial exergame (25 min; twice per week for 14 weeks). The main variables measured were functional capacity, handgrip strength, functional mobility (TUG), functional lower-limb strength (FTSST), aerobic capacity (2-min step test), quality of life (PDQ-39), and Parkinson's disease progression (MDS-UPDRS). the results showed a general improvement in handgrip strength in both hands ( p  = 0.008; d = 0.28), FTSST ( p  = 0.029; d = 0.96), and TUG times ( p  = 0.152; d = 0.22). Aerobic capacity, assessed by a 2-min step test, showed enhanced scores ( p  = 0.031; d = 0.78). Related to the PDQ-39, all dimensions of the scale were enhanced, highlighting activities of daily living ( p  = 0.047; d = 0.29) and bodily discomfort ( p  = 0.041; d = 0.37). Finally, the main symptoms of the disease were reduced, with an improvement in the parameters that show a better incidence of disease progression, such as Part IA and IB ( p  = 0.013; d = 0.29 and  p  = 0.021; d = 0.25, respectively), Part II ( p  = 0.021; d = 0.23), Part III ( p  = 0.040; d = 0.39), and Part IV ( p  = 0.013; d = 0.39). the therapeutic exercise (rowing and cycling), when carried out at a high intensity and in a personalized IVR scenario, appear to be a feasible and safe modality for patients with stages I-III of PD, improving their functional capacity, quality of life, and disease progression.",39311264,3,9,2024
Artificial intelligence and psychedelic medicine.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and psychedelic medicines are among the most high-profile evolving disruptive innovations within mental healthcare in recent years. Although AI and psychedelics may not have historically shared any common ground, there exists the potential for these subjects to combine in generating innovative mental health treatment approaches. In order to inform our perspective, we conducted a scoping review of relevant literature up to late August 2024 via PubMed intersecting AI with psychomedical use of psychedelics. Our perspective covers the potential application of AI in psychedelic medicine for: drug discovery and clinical trial optimization (including pharmacodynamics); study design; understanding psychedelic experiences; personalization of treatments; clinical screening, delivery, and follow-up (potentially delivered via chatbots/apps); application of psychological preparation, integration, and general mental health support; its role in enhancing treatment via brain modulatory devices (including virtual reality and haptic suits); and the consideration of ethical and security safeguards. Challenges include the need for sufficient data protection and security, and a range of necessary ethical protections. Future avenues of exploration could involve directly administering psychedelics (or providing algorithm-generated effects) to inorganic AI-interfaced neural networks that may exceed human brain activity (i.e., cognitive capacity) and intelligence.",39308441,23,9,2024
Virtual Reality as an Adjunct to Traditional Patient Counseling in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Localized Prostate Cancer.,"To determine the utility of a virtual reality (VR) model constructed using patient-derived clinical imaging to improve patient understanding of localized prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis and surgical plan. Patients undergoing robotic radical prostatectomy were selected and demographic data recorded. Patients completed a questionnaire to assess baseline knowledge of their diagnosis after consultation and shared-decision making with their surgeon. A trained non-clinical staff member then guided the patient through a VR experience to view patient-specific anatomy in a 3-dimensional space. Patients then completed the same questionnaire, followed by an additional post-VR questionnaire evaluating patient satisfaction. Questions 1-7 (patient understanding of prostate cancer and treatment plan) and 11-17 (patient opinion of VR) used a standard Likert scale and Questions 8-10 were multiple choice with 1 correct answer. In total, 15 patients were included with an average age of 64.1 years. 6 of 7 questions showed an improvement after VR (P <.001). The percentage of correct responses on Questions 8-10 was higher after VR but not statistically significant (P >.13). Mean responses range from 4.3 to 4.8 (Likert scale, 1 through 5) for the post-VR questionnaire, with a mean total of 31.9 out of 35. This small preliminary investigation of a novel technology to improve the patient experience showed potential as an adjunct to traditional patient counseling. However, due the small sample size and study design, further research is needed to determine the value VR adds to prostate cancer surgical counseling.",39307432,20,9,2024
The Effectiveness of Immersive Virtual Reality as A Complementary Approach and a New Direction in Cancer Related Fatigue Management.,"Background:  Recent advancements in the field of medical technology have illuminated that the implementation of virtual reality interventions can be highly effective in managing cancer-related fatigue. Moreover, this innovative intervention has demonstrated a substantial improvement in patients' overall well-being and daily functioning. Thus, it represents a promising alternative to traditional pharmacological treatments by effectively addressing symptoms and enhancing quality of life. Therefore, the integration of this approach signifies a significant advancement in patient care. Nevertheless, despite the ongoing efforts to diversify non-pharmacological treatments, pharmacological interventions are still the predominant method for managing cancer-related fatigue.  Aim:  This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of immersive virtual reality in cancer-related fatigue management, and to explore the main side effects of immersive virtual reality.  Methods:  This systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards. Several online databases were used to find eligible studies in peer-reviewed journals relevant to the study keywords. Specifically, the included studies were systematic reviews and clinical trials that used immersive virtual reality-based intervention among adult patients with cancer and suffering from cancer-related fatigue. As well as were published in the English language from 2014 to 2024. As well as, three researchers independently contributed to study selections, data extraction, and study evaluations from different aspects: including quality assessment, risk of bias, and study synthesis.  Results:  After an extensive and comprehensive search, a total of ten published studies were included in this review study; 6 articles were quantitative clinical trial studies, and the other 4 were systematic review and meta-analysis studies. The quality of 6 included clinical trials was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool for quantitative studies, the overall result showed that 33.3% of studies rated with moderate quality, no study was rated with low quality, and (66.7%) studies rated as high-quality studies. As well, the quality assessment of all review studies showed that all included systematic reviews and meta-analyses with a low risk of bias and high to moderate power of evidence. The result of this extensive and comprehensive review showed that immersive virtual reality has a significant effect in reducing cancer-related fatigue, however, still, there is a significant variation in the employment of immersive Virtual Reality protocols for cancer symptom management worldwide.  Conclusion:  Immersive virtual reality is an effective non-pharmacological intervention in reducing and controlling cancer-related fatigue among patients with various types of cancer, as well as being an affordable, cost-effective approach. Nevertheless, there remains a notable gap in the existing literature concerning virtual reality protocols, associated side effects, and the underlying mechanisms by which immersive virtual reality alleviates fatigue. Therefore, further research studies are warranted to address these gaps and advance our understanding in these areas.",39305200,NA,NA,NA
"Virtual reality-based therapy after anterior cruciate ligament injury effectively reduces pain and improves knee function, movement patterns, and dynamic balance: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","Virtual reality-based therapy (VRBT) may be an effective physical therapy complement employed in the rehabilitation of patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of VRBT in improving pain, knee function, strength, proprioception, flexion range of motion (ROM), and dynamic balance after ACL injury. We conducted this systematic review with meta-analysis following PRISMA criteria. Since inception to June 2024, we searched in PubMed Medline, WOS, SCOPUS, CINAHL and PEDro without publication date and language restrictions. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), comprising only patients with ACL injury, that assess the effectiveness of VRBT compared to classical interventions on the outcomes of interest were included. PEDro scale was employed to analyze the methodological quality of the RCTs included. Cohen's standardised mean difference (SMD) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used to calculate the pooled effect in meta-analyses. Nine RCTs, providing data from 330 participants (26.96 ± 3.11 years, 85% males) were included. The RCTs included showed good methodological quality (PEDro scale = 6.88 points), being, performance and detection biases, the most common biases reported. Meta-analyses showed that VRBT was more effective than classical interventions in reducing pain (SMD = -1.15; 95% CI -1.85 to -0.45; p = 0.001; I 2  = 0%), and increasing knee function (SMD = 1.71; 95% CI 0.93 to 2.5; p < 0.001; I 2  = 0%), strength (SMD = 0.82; 95% CI 0.4-1.23; p < 0.001; I 2  = 0%) and flexion ROM (SMD = 0.7; 95% CI 0.37-1.01; p < 0.001; I 2  = 0%). Additionally, VRBT improved postero-medial (SMD = 0.46; 95% CI 0.01-0.9; p = 0.045; I 2  = 15.1%) and postero-lateral CoP excursion (SMD = 0.75; 95% CI 0.3-1.21; p = 0.001; I 2  = 0%), being effective in improving dynamic balance. VRBT is an effective physical therapy complement to be included in the ACL's rehabilitation programmes due to reduces pain and increases knee function, strength, ROM and dynamic balance after ACL injury.

Clinicians' perspectives of immersive tools in clinical mental health settings: a systematic scoping review.,"Virtual Reality in mental health treatment has potential to address a wide spectrum of psychological and neurocognitive disorders. Despite the proven benefits, integration into clinical practice faces significant challenges. There is a critical need for research into clinicians' perceptions of virtual reality due to the gap between rapid technological advancements and their adoption in mental health services. A scoping review was conducted to comprehensively understand clinicians' perspectives on the application of immersive virtual reality technologies within mental health settings. 4 data bases were searched, from inception, with the search areas of clinicians', technology, perspectives and mental health. The scoping review followed the PRISMA-ScR checklist. All results were thematically analysed to identify and categorise themes with a focus on qualitative analyses of clinicians' experiences and perceptions of VR applications in therapeutic contexts. 17 articles were selected, encompassing a range of mental health settings. The findings indicate that the integration of VR in clinical environments is heavily influenced by clinicians' knowledge and experience, with unfamiliarity often leading to scepticism. Positive attitudes towards VR, bolstered by direct experience and training, were found to drive acceptance, as clinicians' acknowledged its potential to complement traditional therapies. However, there are still gaps in understanding VR's therapeutic applications, particularly concerning its impact on human interaction and its suitability for specific patient groups. Balancing VR's clinical benefits with ethical and safety concerns is crucial, especially when working with vulnerable populations. Furthermore, structural and administrative support is essential to overcoming the financial and logistical challenges of VR implementation, ensuring its safe and effective integration into mental health care. While VR holds significant potential for enhancing mental health care, its successful integration into clinical practice necessitates addressing existing gaps in knowledge, training, and structural support. By carefully balancing its clinical benefits with ethical, practical, and safety considerations, VR can be effectively utilised as a valuable tool in mental health treatment, providing innovative solutions while ensuring that patient care remains paramount.",39294727,18,9,2024
Investigating the impact of virtual simulation experiment and massive open online course (MOOC) on medical students' wound debridement training: a quasi-experimental study.,"This study aims to evaluate the impact of virtual simulation experiment teaching model and Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) teaching model on the teaching effect in debridement teaching. The study adopted a quasi-experimental design and used virtual simulation technology to construct a virtual simulation experimental teaching platform for debridement. This study was conducted at the Second Clinical College of Wuhan University. The experimental group was composed of 135 third-year clinical medicine students in the 2020 grade, who received the virtual simulation experimental teaching model; the control group was 122 third-year students in the same major in the 2019 grade, who used the MOOC teaching model. The performance of the two groups of students was evaluated through theoretical tests and animal experiment operation. In addition, the effectiveness of the experimental teaching model and student satisfaction were evaluated through questionnaire surveys. The theoretical test scores and animal experiment report scores of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the control group, and the debridement animal experiment operation time of the experimental group was shorter than that of the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The post-class questionnaire survey of the experimental group showed that most students were satisfied with the virtual simulation experimental teaching model and believed that it represented the future teaching trend. In the teaching of debridement, virtual simulation experiment is an effective t teaching model, which not only helps to improve student performance, but also significantly reduces skill operation time and is recognized by students.",39294595,18,9,2024
Exploring Adaptive Virtual Reality Systems Used in Interventions for Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder: Systematic Review.,"Adaptive systems serve to personalize interventions or training based on the user's needs and performance. The adaptation techniques rely on an underlying engine responsible for processing incoming data and generating tailored responses. Adaptive virtual reality (VR) systems have proven to be efficient in data monitoring and manipulation, as well as in their ability to transfer learning outcomes to the real world. In recent years, there has been significant interest in applying these systems to improve deficits associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This is driven by the heterogeneity of symptoms among the population affected, highlighting the need for early customized interventions that target each individual's specific symptom configuration. Recognizing these technology-driven therapeutic tools as efficient solutions, this systematic review aims to explore the application of adaptive VR systems in interventions for young individuals with ASD. An extensive search was conducted across 3 different databases-PubMed Central, Scopus, and Web of Science-to identify relevant studies from approximately the past decade. Each author independently screened the included studies to assess the risk of bias. Studies satisfying the following inclusion criteria were selected: (1) the experimental tasks were delivered via a VR system, (2) system adaptation was automated, (3) the VR system was designed for intervention or training of ASD symptoms, (4) participants' ages ranged from 6 to 19 years, (5) the sample included at least 1 group with ASD, and (6) the adaptation strategy was thoroughly explained. Relevant information extracted from the studies included the sample size and mean age, the study's objectives, the skill trained, the implemented device, the adaptive strategy used, the engine techniques, and the signal used to adapt the systems. Overall, a total of 10 articles were included, involving 129 participants, 76% of whom had ASD. The studies included level switching (7/10, 70%), adaptive feedback strategies (9/10, 90%), and weighing the choice between a machine learning (ML) adaptive engine (3/10, 30%) and a non-ML adaptive engine (8/10, 80%). Adaptation signals ranged from explicit behavioral indicators (6/10, 60%), such as task performance, to implicit biosignals, such as motor movements, eye gaze, speech, and peripheral physiological responses (7/10, 70%). The findings reveal promising trends in the field, suggesting that automated VR systems leveraging real-time progression level switching and verbal feedback driven by non-ML techniques using explicit or, better yet, implicit signal processing have the potential to enhance interventions for young individuals with ASD. The limitations discussed mainly stem from the fact that no technological or automated tools were used to handle data, potentially introducing bias due to human error.",39293060,18,9,2024
Co-designing a virtual reality exposure therapy with students experiencing school anxiety: a proof-of-concept study.,"Anxiety related school avoidance can affect up to 5% of a country's students each year. VRET (Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy) is a novel therapy proven to be as effective as conventional approaches for treating many anxiety disorders. The aim of this research is to co-design and evaluate a VRET intervention for students experiencing school related anxiety. Eighteen adolescents participated in design thinking workshops where they developed a script and storyboard for the VRET. Using an iterative approach, a VRET prototype was developed based on this work. Eighteen teenagers were subsequently recruited to engage with the VRET for one session each and provide feedback on their experience via a structured questionnaire (supervised by a study coordinator) particularly focusing on the ability of the VR experience to reduce school related anxiety. Exposure therapy needs to produce an anxiety response to be effective. The VRET was effective in producing an anxiety response in 89% of participants. Results demonstrated that 93% of participants found the simulations immersive, 94% found the scenarios believable, and 83% could relate to 'Dala', the avatar in the videos. 100% of participants believed that VRET would help with school anxiety. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates favourable face validity indicating promise for this mode of intervention for delivering targeted support to anxious students. VRET could be used as a scalable, cost effective early intervention to reduce the severity of anxiety associated with school avoidance.",39291405,18,9,2024
Exploring the potential of digital therapeutics: An assessment of progress and promise.,"Digital therapeutics (DTx), a burgeoning subset of digital health solutions, has garnered considerable attention in recent times. These cutting-edge therapeutic interventions employ diverse technologies, powered by software algorithms, to treat, manage, and prevent a wide array of diseases and disorders. Although DTx shows significant promise as an integral component of medical care, its widespread integration is still in the preliminary stages. This limited adoption can be largely attributed to the scarcity of comprehensive research that delves into DTx's scope, including its technological underpinnings, potential application areas, and challenges-namely, regulatory hurdles and modest physician uptake. This review aims to bridge this knowledge gap by offering an in-depth overview of DTx products' value to both patients and clinicians. It evaluates the current state of maturity of DTx applications driven by digital technologies and investigates the obstacles that developers and regulators encounter in the market introduction phase.",39291152,12,9,2024
Learner evaluation of an immersive virtual reality mass casualty incident simulator for triage training.,"To minimize loss of life, modern mass casualty response requires swift identification, efficient triage categorization, and rapid hemorrhage control. Current training methods remain suboptimal. Our objective was to train first responders to triage a mass casualty incident using Virtual Reality (VR) simulation and obtain their impressions of the training's quality and effectiveness.We trained subjects in a triage protocol called Sort, Assess, Lifesaving interventions, and Treatment and/or Transport (SALT) Triage then had them respond to a terrorist bombing of a subway station using a fully immersive virtual reality simulation. We gathered learner reactions to their virtual reality experience and post-encounter debriefing with a custom electronic survey. The survey was designed to gather information about participants' demographics and prior experience, including roles, triage training, and virtual reality experience. We then asked them to evaluate the training and encounter and the system's potential for training others. We received 375 completed evaluation surveys from subjects who experienced the virtual reality encounter. Subjects were primarily paramedics, but also included medical learners as well as other emergency medical service (EMS) professionals. Most participants (95%) recommended the experience for other first responders and rated the simulation (95%) and virtual patients (91%) as realistic. Ninety-four percent (94%) of participants rated the virtual reality simulator as ""excellent"" or ""good."" We observed some differences between emergency medical service and medical professionals regarding their prior experience with disaster response training and their opinions on how much the experience contributed to their learning. We observed no differences between subjects with extensive virtual reality experience and those without. Our virtual reality simulator is an automated, customizable, fully immersive virtual reality system for training and assessing personnel in the proper response to a mass casualty incident. Participants perceived the simulator as an adequate alternative to traditional triage and treatment training and believed that the simulator was realistic and effective for training. Prior experience with virtual reality was not a prerequisite for the use of this system.

Examining the audiovisual therapy effects on hospital groups of varying linear canopy landscapes and those with hydrodynamic forces.,"Recent research has highlighted the beneficial effects of urban green spaces on physical and mental health. This study focused on the hospital population and innovatively subdivided the population into four groups: doctors, caregivers, patients and nurses. A total of 96 volunteers participated in this virtual reality experiment to assess the restoration of a linear canopy landscape and a landscape with different levels of hydrodynamics through interactive audiovisual immersion. We utilized pre-research method, brainwave monitoring technique, psychological scales, observation and interviews in this experiment. The research identified five key findings. First, both linear canopy landscapes and those with low to medium hydrodynamic forces significantly enhance physiological and psychological restoration for all groups, with the most substantial physiological benefits observed in doctors and patients, and the greatest psychological relief noted in caregivers. Second, landscapes with medium hydrodynamic forces yield higher restorative effects than those with low forces in hospital settings. Third, green landscapes with medium and low-density canopies prove more conducive to patient recovery compared to those with high-density canopies. Fourth, the inclusion of bird songs does not markedly affect physiological restoration across the hospital groups. Finally, landscapes that incorporate elements of water dynamics, open skies, and lightly foliated canopies draw significant interest from all groups involved. This study advocates for the integration of natural blue and green elements into hospital environments as complementary therapeutic interventions, aiming to alleviate stress and promote health recovery among hospital communities.",39290411,3,9,2024
Virtual reality education on myalgic encephalomyelitis for medical students and healthcare professionals: a pilot study.,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/ chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic condition which may be characterised by debilitating fatigue, post-exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, and cognitive difficulties. ME/CFS has significant negative impact on quality of life for those living with the condition. This may be exacerbated by a lack of knowledge within healthcare regarding the condition. Previous research has found that immersive virtual reality (VR) educational experiences within healthcare education can increase knowledge and empathy. The present study employed a quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test design to investigate the impact of a short immersive VR educational experience on knowledge of ME/CFS and empathy for those living with the condition. The VR experience placed participants into a virtual scene which told real life stories of the experience of people living with ME/CFS and their families. 43 participants completed in this pilot study: 28 medical students and 15 primary care health professionals. Participants completed measures of knowledge of ME/CFS and empathy before and after engagement with the experience. A statistically significant increase was found for levels of knowledge (p < .001, d = 0.74) and empathy (p < .001, d = 1.56) from pre-VR experience levels to post-VR experience levels with a medium and large effect size, respectively. Further analysis revealed no statistically significant difference between baseline levels of knowledge of ME/CFS between healthcare professionals and medical students. The present study is the first to explore the use of this short immersive VR experience as an education tool within healthcare to increase knowledge of ME/CFS, and empathy for those living with the condition. Findings allude to the previously established lack of knowledge of ME/CFS within healthcare although promisingly the increases in knowledge and empathy found suggest that this immersive VR experience has potential to address this. Such changes found in this small-scale pilot study suggest that future research into the use of VR as an educational tool within this setting may be beneficial. Use of a control group, and larger sample size as well as investigation of retention of these changes may also enhance future research.",39289650,17,9,2024
Virtual reality simulation for mastery learning of wrist radiograph technique.,"Virtual reality (VR) simulation is a technology that empowers students and radiographers to practice radiography in a virtual environment that resembles real-life clinical scenarios. The purpose of this randomised study was to examine the relationship between clinical specialty and the ability to assess and obtain a lateral wrist radiograph using a VR simulator. Radiographers and radiography students were recruited from the EFRS Research Hub at the 2024 European Congress of Radiology. After completing a background questionnaire, participants entered a VR simulator where they assessed lateral wrist radiographs and, if necessary, attempted a retake. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the relationship between specialties and participants' ability to assess positioning and perform retakes. Rank-biserial correlation estimated the relationship between participants' ability to reposition the VR patient and their VR experience and self-perceived confidence in wrist radiograph positioning. The cohort included 173 participants from 14 specialties across 21 countries. There was a borderline significant trend between clinical specialty and correct positioning assessment (p = 0.052) and between self-perceived confidence in acquiring wrist radiographs and repositioning for a retake (p = 0.052). Neither clinical specialty (p = 0.480) nor previous VR experience (p = 0.409) correlated with ability to reposition for a retake. While results indicated a potential correlation between participants' ability to position a VR patient and both clinical specialty and confidence in wrist radiography, these trends were not statistically significant. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that VR holds promise for radiography training, though further research is necessary to explore the factors that influence performance and learning. The incorporation of VR technology into standard radiography training programs could potentially improve patient outcomes by ensuring that radiography students are more skilled at acquiring quality radiographs prior to their first clinical practice. It should be noted though, that knowledge on positioning criteria and anatomy is an advantage when practicing correct positioning in a VR simulator.",39288469,16,9,2024
Operative Adjuncts in Pediatric Brain Tumor Surgery with a Focus on Suprasellar Tumors.,"The primary objective of surgery for brain tumor resection has always been maximizing safe resection while minimizing the risk to normal brain tissue. Technological advances applied in the operating room help surgeons to achieve this objective. This chapter discusses specific tools and approaches in the operating environment that target safe surgery for brain tumors in children, with a focus on pathologies in the sellar/suprasellar region. Particular focus is given to tools that help with safe patient positioning; intraoperative imaging modalities; and chemical visualization adjuncts. Both static (preoperative images used for neuronavigation) and dynamic (images updated during the procedure) intraoperative imaging modalities are discussed. There is further overview of operative rehearsal and preparation strategies, which are rapidly evolving as virtual reality systems become more commonplace. While the rapid evolution of intraoperative adjuncts in neurosurgery means the status of a given technology as novel is quite transient, this chapter offers a snapshot of the current state of advanced intraoperative tools for pediatric brain tumor surgery.",39287800,NA,NA,NA
Evolution of treatment for unspecific back pain: From past to future.,"Unspecific back pain (UBP) has long puzzled medical professionals. Historically, back pain (BP) was often attributed to mystical causes, treated with incantations or herbal concoctions. The Middle Ages shifted towards empirical practices, though still intertwined with superstition, using methods like leeches and bloodletting. The Renaissance introduced systematic healthcare approaches, laying the foundation for modern medicine. The 20th century saw significant advancements with diagnostic imaging, pharmacotherapy, physical therapy, and surgical interventions, though UBP remained elusive. Recent decades have seen a paradigm shift towards multidisciplinary approaches, addressing BP's multifactorial nature through holistic methods considering biomechanical, psychosocial, and lifestyle factors. This shift integrates quantitative research with hermeneutic interpretation, emphasizing evidence-based guidelines. Non-pharmacological interventions such as exercise therapy, electrotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and mindfulness-based stress reduction have gained prominence, empowering individuals in their recovery. Technological innovations like virtual reality and artificial intelligence offer personalized treatment plans, optimizing outcomes. The future of BP treatment holds promise with advancements in regenerative medicine, neuromodulation, telemedicine, and remote monitoring platforms, enhancing accessibility and continuity of care, especially in underserved communities. However, challenges such as the opioid epidemic and healthcare disparities remain, necessitating judicious prescribing practices and equitable resource distribution. The evolving treatment landscape for UBP reflects the dynamic interplay between scientific progress, clinical innovation, and societal needs, aiming to alleviate the burden of back pain and improve quality of life.",39287341,5,9,2024

Training of spatial cognitive abilities reduces symptoms of visually induced motion sickness.,"This study aims to explore the effectiveness of enhancing individual spatial cognitive abilities in alleviating the negative symptoms of visually induced motion sickness (VIMS). Additionally, it seeks to develop innovative intervention methods to improve spatial cognition and identify new treatment approaches for VIMS. The study investigated the impact of innovative interventions on spatial cognitive abilities and their modulation of VIMS susceptibility. A total of 43 participants were recruited (23 in the experimental group and 20 in the control group). The experimental group underwent six sessions of spatial cognitive ability training, while the control group engaged in activities unrelated to spatial cognition. The analysis revealed that the spatial cognitive ability scores of the experimental group significantly improved after the intervention. Furthermore, the experimental group exhibited significant differences in nausea, oculomotor, disorientation, and total SSQ scores before and after the intervention, indicating that the intervention effectively mitigated VIMS symptoms. This study developed a virtual reality training method that effectively enhances individual spatial cognitive abilities and significantly alleviates VIMS symptoms, providing a novel and effective approach for VIMS intervention and treatment.",39286562,2,9,2024
Comparative efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for anxiety in adult intensive care unit patients: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"The primary goal of the intensive care unit is to the anxiety of conscious patients is often ignored in the care unit. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of various non-pharmacological therapies for anxiety disorders in adult patients in the intensive care unit, in order to enhance humanistic care in the intensive care unit and to promote the patients' physical and mental recovery together. We conducted a systematic and comprehensive search of the literature in five databases (including the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EBSCO, Web of Science, and Embase) covering nearly a decade for randomized controlled trials of non-pharmacological therapies to reduce anxiety in adult intensive care unit patients. Two researchers independently assessed the quality of the literature, collected and condensed the data, and used STATA software to perform a network meta-analysis. The ranking probabilities for each intervention were calculated using the Surface under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) method. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO. This study ultimately included 26 randomized controlled trials involving 2791 adult ICU patients. Non-pharmacological interventions for anxiety in adult ICU patients included music therapy, aromatherapy, ICU diary, virtual reality, massage therapy, monitoring room diary, and health education. when compared to the control group (usual care), aromatherapy + music therapy [MD = -2.65, 95% CI (-4.76, -0.54)] (P = 0.0137) and music therapy [MD = -1.77, 95% CI (-3.40, -0.13)] (P = 0.0338) were superior in reducing anxiety in adult ICU patients. The results of the network meta-analysis showed that aromatherapy combined with music therapy significantly alleviated anxiety in adult ICU patients (SUCRA: 99.8%). Music therapy combined with aromatherapy has demonstrated superior effectiveness compared to other non-pharmacological interventions for reducing anxiety in awake adults in the ICU. However, the underlying mechanisms of this combined therapy require further exploration. Future research on the use of music therapy combined with aromatherapy in the care unit may help reduce anxiety in patients while fostering their physical and mental healing; however, individual variances and unique clinical circumstances must be considered.",39284718,16,9,2024
Evaluating Joint Angle Data for Clinical Assessment Using Multidimensional Inverse Kinematics with Average Segment Morphometry.,"Movement analysis is a critical tool in understanding and addressing various disabilities associated with movement deficits. By analyzing movement patterns, healthcare professionals can identify the root causes of these alterations, which is essential for preventing, diagnosing, and rehabilitating a broad spectrum of medical conditions, disabilities, and injuries. With the advent of affordable motion capture technologies, quantitative data on patient movement is more accessible to clinicians, enhancing the quality of care. Nonetheless, it is crucial that these technologies undergo rigorous validation to ensure their accuracy in collecting and monitoring patient movements, particularly for remote healthcare services where direct patient observation is not possible. In this study, motion capture technology was used to track upper extremity movements during a reaching task presented in virtual reality. Kinematic data was then calculated for each participant using a scaled dynamic inertial model. The goal was to evaluate the accuracy of joint angle calculations using inverse kinematics from motion capture relative to the typical movement redundancy. Shoulder, elbow, radioulnar, and wrist joint angles were calculated with models scaled using either direct measurements of each individual's arm segment lengths or those lengths were calculated from individual height using published average proportions. The errors in joint angle trajectories calculated using the two methods of model scaling were compared to the inter-trial variability of those trajectories. The variance of this error was primarily within the normal range of variability between repetitions of the same movements. This suggests that arm joint angles can be inferred with good enough accuracy from motion capture data and individual height to be useful for the clinical assessment of motor deficits.",39282382,7,9,2024

Ecological virtual reality-based cognitive remediation among inpatients with schizophrenia: A pilot study.,"Schizophrenia presents a considerable clinical challenge due to limited progress in promoting daily-life functioning among diagnosed individuals. Although cognitive remediation (CR) has emerged as a promising approach to improving cognitive and functional outcomes in schizophrenia, its effectiveness among inpatients and within hospital environments-where opportunities to practice skills in real-world contexts are limited-remains unclear. Here, we aimed to establish the feasibility and initial efficacy of a short, ecological virtual reality-based CR training (CR-EVR) in acute mental health inpatient settings. Efficacy was assessed at four levels: training engagement, near transfer, far transfer, and ecological transfer. Twenty-three inpatients with schizophrenia (Male: 33.3 ± 8.5; 4 Female) completed 8, 20-min CR-EVR sessions, with exercises training the cognitive abilities of inhibition, planning, working memory, shifting, self-initiation, persistence, and attention. Their cognitive functioning, schizophrenia symptoms, functional capacity, and participation in occupations were evaluated pre- and post-training to address four levels of effectiveness. Of the recruited participants, 25.8 % dropped out. Inpatients who completed the full protocol reported high rates of satisfaction (1-not satisfied; 5-very satisfied)) from the intervention (Median = 4, IQR:3.5-5). Post-training, significant improvements were found in the trained cognitive components (intervention engagement: -6.58 < t/Z < 2.02,  p  < .05), general cognitive functioning (-2.59 < t/Z < 2.29,  p  < .05), functional capacity ( t  = -2.9, p < .05), and diversity of participation in everyday activities ( t  = -3.36, p < .05). This preliminary study suggests that CR-EVR may be a feasible and practical tool to enhance cognitive and ecological outcomes in short-stay acute inpatient settings. Subject to further research, such intervention may be considered an add-on to current practices that promote recovery and health among inpatient populations.",39281321,28,8,2024
Effect of virtual reality-based visual training for myopia control in children: a randomized controlled trial.,"To assess the efficacy and safety of virtual reality-based visual training (VRVT) in myopia control among children. The randomized, parallel-group, single-blind clinical trial conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology of Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital enrolled 65 low-myopic children (aged 8 to 13 years) with cycloplegic spherical equivalent (SE) between - 0.50 and - 3.00 diopters (D), astigmatism less than - 1.00 D, anisometropia less than 1.50D, and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) more than 0.0 logarithm (LogMAR) of the minimum angle of resolution. The participants were enrolled in December 2020, and the follow-up of this study concluded on August 2021. Children were assigned randomly to the intervention group (VRVT plus single-vision spectacle [SVS]) and the control group (only SVS without receiving VRVT). The intervention group was administered for 20 min per day with VRVT under parental supervision at home. The primary outcome was changes in axial length (AL) at 3 months. Macular choroidal thickness (mCT) was regarded as a key secondary outcome. Among 65 participants (mean age: 10.8 years, 52.3% male), 60 children (92.3%) who completed the 3-month intervention and 6-month follow-up were included in the analysis (30 in the intervention group and 30 in the control group). The changes of AL were 0.063 ± 0.060 mm (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.074 to 0.119 mm) in the intervention group and 0.129 ± 0.060 mm (95% CI, 0.107 to 0.152 mm) and in the control group at 3 months (t = - 2.135, P = 0.037), and the mean difference between the two groups was 0.066 mm. The change of mCT were 22.633 ± 36.171 μm (95% CI, 9.127 to 36.140 μm) in the intervention group and - 3.000 ± 31.056 μm (95% CI, - 14.597 to 8.597 μm) in the control group at 3 months (t = 2.945, P = 0.005). VR vertigo was the most common adverse event which was occurred in two children (2/30, 6.67%) in the intervention group. VRVT is a promising method for myopia control in children with good user acceptability. Among children aged 8 to 13 years with low-myopia, nightly use of VRVT resulted in slowing myopia progression. This protocol was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06250920), retrospectively registered on 01 February 2024.",39278928,16,9,2024

Brain Neuroplasticity Leveraging Virtual Reality and Brain-Computer Interface Technologies.,"This study explores neuroplasticity through the use of virtual reality (VR) and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections in response to learning, experience, and injury. VR offers a controlled environment to manipulate sensory inputs, while BCIs facilitate real-time monitoring and modulation of neural activity. By combining VR and BCI, researchers can stimulate specific brain regions, trigger neurochemical changes, and influence cognitive functions such as memory, perception, and motor skills. Key findings indicate that VR and BCI interventions are promising for rehabilitation therapies, treatment of phobias and anxiety disorders, and cognitive enhancement. Personalized VR experiences, adapted based on BCI feedback, enhance the efficacy of these interventions. This study underscores the potential for integrating VR and BCI technologies to understand and harness neuroplasticity for cognitive and therapeutic applications. The researchers utilized the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) method to conduct a comprehensive and systematic review of the existing literature on neuroplasticity, VR, and BCI. This involved identifying relevant studies through database searches, screening for eligibility, and assessing the quality of the included studies. Data extraction focused on the effects of VR and BCI on neuroplasticity and cognitive functions. The PRISMA method ensured a rigorous and transparent approach to synthesizing evidence, allowing the researchers to draw robust conclusions about the potential of VR and BCI technologies in promoting neuroplasticity and cognitive enhancement.",39275636,3,9,2024
Use of Virtual Reality in School-Aged Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder: A Novel Approach.,"Virtual reality (VR) applications in paediatric rehabilitation are recent but promising. This brief report describes a VR rehabilitation program for a small sample of children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). The program focused explicitly on executive functions, a key area of concern for this population. It was conducted over 11 weeks in the CARE Lab. This lab was designed with appropriate structural characteristics and sophisticated technology to provide a rehabilitative setting with recreational and semi-immersive features. Before and after the VR training, the children were evaluated in terms of visual attention, inhibition, planning abilities, and visual-motor coordination. The rehabilitation programs were customised according to the clinical needs and the functional profile of each patient, proposing different games with variable complexity levels. These preliminary results showed a global and clinically significant change in executive functions, especially visual attention and inhibition skills. These findings suggest interesting implications for clinical practice, providing new information for professionals regarding the application of VR in the field of paediatric rehabilitation.",39275489,28,8,2024
Analysis of Gait Kinematics in Smart Walker-Assisted Locomotion in Immersive Virtual Reality Scenario.,"The decline in neuromusculoskeletal capabilities of older adults can affect motor control, independence, and locomotion. Because the elderly population is increasing worldwide, assisting independent mobility and improving rehabilitation therapies has become a priority. The combination of rehabilitation robotic devices and virtual reality (VR) tools can be used in gait training to improve clinical outcomes, motivation, and treatment adherence. Nevertheless, VR tools may be associated with cybersickness and changes in gait kinematics. This paper analyzes the gait parameters of fourteen elderly participants across three experimental tasks: free walking (FW), smart walker-assisted gait (AW), and smart walker-assisted gait combined with VR assistance (VRAW). The kinematic parameters of both lower limbs were captured by a 3D wearable motion capture system. This research aims at assessing the kinematic adaptations when using a smart walker and how the integration between this robotic device and the VR tool can influence such adaptations. Additionally, cybersickness symptoms were investigated using a questionnaire for virtual rehabilitation systems after the VRAW task. The experimental data indicate significant differences between FW and both AW and VRAW. Specifically, there was an overall reduction in sagittal motion of 16%, 25%, and 38% in the hip, knee, and ankle, respectively, for both AW and VRAW compared to FW. However, no significant differences between the AW and VRAW kinematic parameters and no adverse symptoms related to VR were identified. These results indicate that VR technology can be used in walker-assisted gait rehabilitation without compromising kinematic performance and presenting potential benefits related to motivation and treatment adherence.",39275445,27,8,2024
Xbox Kinect Sports vs. Nintendo Switch Sports and Their Effects on Body Composition and Physical Performance in Older Females: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Background/Objectives : This study aimed to compare the effects of Xbox Kinect Sports (XKS) regarding Nintendo Switch Sports (NSS) and an inactive control group (CG) on body composition (body fat percentage, BFP; and fat-free mass) and physical performance (maximal isometric handgrip strength, MIHS; 30-s chair stand, 30-S; timed up-and-go, TUG; sit-and-reach; and 2-min step) in physically inactive older females.  Methods:  A randomized controlled trial study was conducted with three parallel groups: XKS (n = 13), NSS (n = 14), and CG (n = 16) considering three weekly 60-min sessions for 12 weeks with pre- and post-assessments.  Results:  A two-factor mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with repeated measures was performed to measure the time × group effect. Multiple comparisons revealed significant differences in BFP (F (2,18)  = 6.12;  p  = 0.005; ηp 2  = 0.226, large effect), 30-S (F (2,18)  = 20.7;  p  = 0.000; ηp 2  = 0.496, large effect), TUG (F (2,18)  = 10.0;  p  = 0.000; ηp 2  = 0.323, large effect), sit-and-reach (F (2,18)  = 37.3;  p  = 0.000; ηp 2  = 0.640, large effect), and 2-min step (F (2,18)  = 9.85;  p  = 0.000; ηp 2  = 0.319, large effect) in favor of XKS regarding NSS and CG. The intragroup results only present in XKS a significant decrease in BFP ( p  = 0.02; d = 0.98) and significant improvements in the 30-S ( p  = 0.000; d = 1.88), TUG ( p  < 0.01; d = 2.00), sit-and-reach ( p  = 0.003; d = 2.58), and 2-min step ( p  = 0.004; d = 1.05).  Conclusions:  training using XKS significantly decreases BFP and improves 30-S, TUG, sit-and-reach, and 2-min step in physically inactive older females.",39274198,23,8,2024
Virtual Reality Cognitive Remediation in Older Adults with Bipolar Disorder: The Effects on Cognitive Performance and Depression in a Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Dementia, depression, and cardiovascular disease are major public health concerns for older adults, requiring early intervention. This study investigates whether a virtual reality cognitive remediation program (VR-CR) can improve cognitive function and depressive symptoms in older adults, and determines the necessary sample size for future studies. Integrated VR and CR interventions have shown promising outcomes in older adults with neurodegenerative and mental health disorders. This secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial involves adults aged 58-75 years with bipolar disorder, excluding those with acute episodes, epilepsy, or severe eye diseases. The experimental group received standard treatment plus VR-CR, while the control group received only standard treatment. No baseline differences were found between the experimental and control groups. No significant improvement was observed in the overall cognitive function test ( p  = 0.897) or in depressive symptoms ( p  = 0.322). A phase III efficacy study requires a sample size of 28 participants (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.20). VR-CR can potentially treat depressive symptoms in adults and older adults, but the results support conducting phase III studies to further investigate these outcomes. However, the improvement in cognitive performance in the elderly is less pronounced than in younger individuals.",39273777,3,9,2024
Impact of VR-Based Cognitive Training on Working Memory and Inhibitory Control in IDD Young Adults.,"Young people with intellectual developmental disabilities have a persistent delay in the development of executive functions. Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly being used as a cognitive intervention tool, with significant effectiveness demonstrated in different types of populations. This pilot study aims to investigate the impact of a cognitive training program utilizing VR on young adults diagnosed with intellectual developmental disabilities (IDDs). The participants (N = 15) served as their own control group and were assessed three times: weeks 0, 8, and 16, with a rest period (0-8 weeks) and an intervention period (8-16 weeks). The assessments included measures of cognitive function provided by E-Prime ®  (Version 3). Overall, an improvement in working memory and inhibitory control was found after the intervention, but not in sustained attention. These findings suggest that VR-based cognitive training holds promise as an effective intervention for enhancing cognitive abilities in young adults with intellectual developmental disabilities. This study provides a foundation for future investigations into VR's role in cognitive rehabilitation and its potential to support daily living skills and overall quality of life for individuals with IDDs. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects and broader applicability of VR interventions.",39273729,26,8,2024

Augmented reality- virtual reality wartime training of reserve prehospital teams: a pilot study.,"In the realm of trauma response preparation for prehospital teams, the combination of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) with manikin technologies is growing in importance for creating training scenarios that closely mirror potential real-life situations. The pilot study focused on training of airway management and intubation for trauma incidents, based on a Trauma AR-VR simulator involving reserve paramedics of the National EMS service (Magen David Adom) who had not practiced for up to six years, activated during the Israel-Gaza conflict (October 2023). The trauma simulator merges the physical and virtual realms by utilizing a real manikin and instruments outfitted with sensors. This integration enables a precise one-to-one correspondence between the physical and virtual environments. Considering the importance of enhancing the preparedness of the reserve paramedics to support the prehospital system in Israel, the study aims to ascertain the impact of AR-VR Trauma simulator training on the modification of key perceptual attitudes such as self-efficacy, resilience, knowledge, and competency among reserve paramedics in Israel. A quantitative questionnaire was utilized to gauge the influence of AR-VR training on specific psychological and skill-based metrics, including self-efficacy, resilience, medical knowledge, professional competency, confidence in performing intubations, and the perceived quality of the training experience in this pilot study. The methodology entailed administering a pre-training questionnaire, delivering a targeted 30-minute AR-VR training session on airway management techniques, and collecting post-training data through a parallel questionnaire to measure the training's impact. Fifteen reserve paramedics were trained, with a response rate of 80% (n = 12) in both measurements. Post-training evaluations indicated a significant uptick in all measured areas, with resilience (3.717±0.611 to 4.008±0.665) and intubation confidence (3.541±0.891 to 3.833±0.608) showing particularly robust gains. The high rating (4.438±0.419 on a scale of 5) of the training quality suggests positive response to the AR-VR integration for the enhancement of medical training, CONCLUSIONS: The application of AR-VR in the training of reserve paramedics demonstrates potential as a key tool for their swift mobilization and efficiency in crisis response. This is particularly valuable for training when quick deployment of personnel is necessary, training resources are diminished, and 'all hands on deck' is necessary.",39267143,12,9,2024

Secondary outcomes included mood, sleep, global impression of change, and physical responses. Data extraction included participant demographics, stroke etiology, pain characteristics, pain reduction scores, and secondary outcome metrics. Forty-two original studies were included, with a total of 1,451 participants. No studies providing psychological therapy to CPSP patients were identified. Twelve studies met requirements for a random-effects meta-analyses that found pharmacological therapy to have a small effect on mean pain score (SMD = -.36, 96.0% confidence interval [-.68, -.03]), physical interventions did not show a significant effect (SMD = -.55 [-1.28, .18]), and neuromodulation treatments had a moderate effect (SMD = -.64 [-1.08, -.19]). Fourteen studies were included in proportional meta-analysis with pharmacological studies having a moderate effect (58.3% mean pain reduction [-36.51, -80.15]) and neuromodulation studies a small effect (31.1% mean pain reduction [-43.45, -18.76]). Sixteen studies were included in the narrative review, the findings from which largely supported meta-analysis results. Duloxetine, amitriptyline, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation had the most robust evidence for their effectiveness in alleviating CPSP-induced pain. Further multicenter placebo-controlled research is needed to ascertain the effectiveness of physical therapies, such as acupuncture and virtual reality, and invasive and noninvasive neuromodulation treatments. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents a top-down and bottom-up overview of evidence for the effectiveness of different pharmacological, physical, and neuromodulation treatments of CPSP. This review could provide clinicians with a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness and tolerability of different treatment types.",39260808,12,9,2024
Effects of Virtual Reality Motor-Cognitive Training for Older People With Cognitive Frailty: Multicentered Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Cognitive frailty refers to a clinical syndrome in which physical frailty and mild cognitive impairment coexist. Motor-cognitive training and virtual reality (VR) have been used to launch various therapeutic modalities to promote health in older people. The literature advocates that motor-cognitive training and VR are effective in promoting the cognitive and physical function of older people. However, the effects on older people with cognitive frailty are unclear. This study examined the effects of VR motor-cognitive training (VRMCT) on global cognitive function, physical frailty, walking speed, visual short-term memory, inhibition of cognitive interference, and executive function in older people with cognitive frailty. This study used a multicentered, assessor-blinded, 2-parallel-group randomized controlled trial design. Participants were recruited face-to-face in 8 older adult community centers. Eligible participants were aged ≥60 years, were community dwelling, lived with cognitive frailty, had no dementia, and were not mobility restricted. In the intervention group, participants received VRMCT led by interventionists with 16 one-hour training sessions delivered twice per week for 8 weeks. In the control group, participants received the usual care provided by the older adult community centers that the investigators did not interfere with. The primary outcome was global cognitive function. The secondary outcomes included physical frailty, walking speed, verbal short-term memory, inhibition of cognitive interference, and executive function. Data were collected at baseline (T0) and the week after the intervention (T1). Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the group, time, and interaction (time × group) effects on the outcomes. In total, 293 eligible participants enrolled in the study. The mean age of the participants was 74.5 (SD 6.8) years. Most participants were female (229/293, 78.2%), had completed primary education (152/293, 52.1%), were married (167/293, 57.2%), lived with friends (127/293, 43.3%), and had no VR experience (232/293, 79.5%). In the intervention group, 81.6% (119/146) of participants attended >80% (13/16, 81%) of the total number of sessions. A negligible number of participants experienced VR sickness symptoms (1/146, 0.7% to 5/146, 3%). VRMCT was effective in promoting global cognitive function (interaction effect: P=.03), marginally promoting executive function (interaction effect: P=.07), and reducing frailty (interaction effect: P=.03). The effects were not statistically significant on other outcomes. VRMCT is effective in promoting cognitive functions and reducing physical frailty and is well tolerated and accepted by older people with cognitive frailty, as evidenced by its high attendance rate and negligible VR sickness symptoms. Further studies should examine the efficacy of the intervention components (eg, VR vs non-VR or dual task vs single task) on health outcomes, the effect of using technology on intervention adherence, and the long-term effects of the intervention on older people with cognitive frailty at the level of daily living.

"Effects of Virtual Reality-Based Mirror Therapy on Upper Extremity Motor Function, Manual Performance and Gross Manual Dexterity Among Stroke Patients: A Meta-Analysis.","In recent years, innovative technologies have gained prominence in stroke patient rehabilitation worldwide, with virtual reality-based mirror therapy (VRBMT) emerging as a notable example. Hence, the present study aims to determine the efficacy of VRBMT on upper extremity motor function, manual performance, and gross manual dexterity among stroke patients. The systematic search utilized Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Design (PICOD) paradigm, and the study searched was based on 2012-2023, utilizing different databases. The meta-analysis data was evaluated using MedCalc version 18.11.3. The Pooled effect size mean was statistically examined using a fixed and random effect model. Among the 6 studies selected, 4 studies involving upper-limb stroke patients were identified between the VRBMT. Pooled analysis of VRBMT revealed no significant effect on motor function [standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.815; 95% CI 0.00 to 81.37; P = 0.5562]. The remaining 2 of 6 studies participated in the study of the manual performance stroke patients (SMD 0.869; 95% CI 0.00 to 93.22; P = 0.0684). The pooled analysis of VRBMT revealed no significant effect. The last 2 of 6 included studies on gross manual dexterity in stroke. The pooled analysis also showed no significant effects on VRBMT (SMD 0.198; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.00; P = 0.6951). The present study concluded although VRBMT exhibits potential as a novel method for stroke rehabilitation, its effects on gross manual dexterity, manual performance, and upper extremity motor function are not statistically significant may be due to a limited number of studies on VRBMT in stroke patients.",39257864,1,8,2024
Comparative Efficacy of Cognitive Training for Post-Stroke Aphasia: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.,"Although cognitive training has shown potential for treating post-stroke aphasia (PSA), its efficacy varies across studies, and the optimal training approaches remain unclear. To evaluate and compare the effects of distinct cognitive training interventions, either combined with or independent of speech and language therapy (SLT), on language function in individuals with PSA. A systematic search encompassing PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, VIP, and Chinese Biomedical Databases was conducted for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A network meta-analysis evaluated interventions, including computer-assisted cognitive training (CCT), conventional cognitive training (CT), virtual reality (VR)-based cognitive training (vrCT), telerehabilitation computer-assisted cognitive training (tCCT), working memory (WM) training, and attention training (AT). Eleven RCTs comprising 501 participants were included. Individuals with PSA who underwent combined WM training with SLT led to significantly enhanced Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) Aphasia Quotient (AQ), as well as in spontaneous speech, auditory comprehension, repetition, and naming, compared to those receiving SLT alone. This combination was more effective than both CCT with SLT and tCCT with SLT in improving WAB AQ. Similarly, it outperformed both CCT with SLT and vrCT with SLT in enhancing WAB spontaneous speech. Additionally, both AT and CT combined with SLT were more effective than SLT alone in enhancing WAB spontaneous speech. Specifically, AT combined with SLT proved more effective than vrCT with SLT in this area. Moreover, vrCT combined with SLT significantly improved auditory comprehension compared with SLT alone. Combining WM training and SLT and integrating vrCT with SLT both significantly enhance language function in individuals with PSA, compared with SLT alone. Our findings advocate for the use of these cognitive training approaches as promising strategies for language rehabilitation in this population.

The effect of virtual reality glasses on pain and patient satisfaction in arteriovenous fistula cannulation procedure.,"To determine the effect of virtual reality glasses intervention on pain, vital signs, and patient satisfaction of hemodialysis patients undergoing AVF catheter puncture. Randomized controlled study. The study was conducted in 60 patients receiving dialysis treatment in the HD unit of a public hospital in Turkey. The data were collected via the ""Patient Identification Form"", ""Visual Analog Scale/VAS"" and ""Hemodynamics Variables Inspection Form"". The patients in the experiment group watched videos through the virtual reality glasses for totally 5 minutes in average, 2 minutes before the AVF cannulation process and 3 minutes during the process. No intervention was applied to the patients in the control group other than the normal nursing interventions in the HD unit. In the intra-group comparisons, the 2nd and 3rd measurement average pain level scores of the patients with in the experimental group were determined to be statistically significantly lower compared to their 1st measurement (p < 0.05); the 3rd measurement average pain level scores of the control group were determined to be statistically significantly lower compared to their 1st and 2nd measurements (p < 0.05). It was determined that the virtual reality glasses decreased the pain that emerges during the AVF cannulation process and increased the patient satisfaction level. It is suggested that the virtual reality glasses should be used by the nurses in the HD unit since it is easily applicable in coping with pain in the patients and since it is an invasive method.",39256013,17,8,2024
A Framework for Multimodal Medical Image Interaction.,"Medical doctors rely on images of the human anatomy, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to localize regions of interest in the patient during diagnosis and treatment. Despite advances in medical imaging technology, the information conveyance remains unimodal. This visual representation fails to capture the complexity of the real, multisensory interaction with human tissue. However, perceiving multimodal information about the patient's anatomy and disease in real-time is critical for the success of medical procedures and patient outcome. We introduce a Multimodal Medical Image Interaction (MMII) framework to allow medical experts a dynamic, audiovisual interaction with human tissue in three-dimensional space. In a virtual reality environment, the user receives physically informed audiovisual feedback to improve the spatial perception of anatomical structures. MMII uses a model-based sonification approach to generate sounds derived from the geometry and physical properties of tissue, thereby eliminating the need for hand-crafted sound design. Two user studies involving 34 general and nine clinical experts were conducted to evaluate the proposed interaction framework's learnability, usability, and accuracy. Our results showed excellent learnability of audiovisual correspondence as the rate of correct associations significantly improved (p < 0.001) over the course of the study. MMII resulted in superior brain tumor localization accuracy (p < 0.05) compared to conventional medical image interaction. Our findings substantiate the potential of this novel framework to enhance interaction with medical images, for example, during surgical procedures where immediate and precise feedback is needed.",39255140,10,9,2024
Harnessing the therapeutic effects of nature for chronic Pain: A role for immersive virtual reality? A narrative review.,"There is a growing interest in the relationship between nature and pain relief. Evidence from environmental psychology, neuroscience and physiology-based studies point towards analgesic effects of nature being mediated through various cognitive, affective and/or autonomic factors. Being able to harness these therapeutic effects using immersive virtual reality (VR) could help to optimize and improve accessibility of nature-based environments as part of chronic pain management plans. In this narrative review, we present evidence supporting a new theoretical framework for nature-based analgesia and suggest ways for applying this through immersive VR. We provide an overview of the evidence on (1) the therapeutic effects of nature on pain, (2) environmental psychology theory that underpins the health benefits of nature, (3) key mechanistic evidence from nature neuroimaging and physiology-based studies, (4) previous studies that have used VR-based nature in pain research and (5) how to design effective VR interventions that can be used to integrate nature into immersive 360 environments. We have demonstrated how environmental psychology, neuroscience and physiology-based research can be used to form a novel theoretical framework for nature-based analgesia. Using this framework, we identify how key aspects of nature can act as analgesic and how this can be harnessed using immersive VR. Through developing this theoretical framework, we have provided a foundation on which to guide future experimental and clinical studies as well as helping to improve the accessibility of nature for chronic pain patients through immersive VR technologies. This review article summarizes key multidisciplinary evidence to help understand how nature exerts beneficial effects on pain processing. The use of this theoretical framework alongside advances in immersive VR technologies provides a springboard for future research and can be used to help develop new nature-based therapeutics using VR.",39254114,10,9,2024
Perception and control of a virtual body in immersive virtual reality for rehabilitation.,"This review explores recent advances in using immersive virtual reality to improve bodily perception and motor control in rehabilitation across musculoskeletal and neurological conditions, examining how virtual reality's unique capabilities can address the challenges of traditional approaches. The potential in this area of the emerging metaverse and the integration of artificial intelligence in virtual reality are discussed. In musculoskeletal rehabilitation, virtual reality shows promise in enhancing motivation, adherence, improving range of motion, and reducing kinesiophobia, particularly postsurgery. For neurological conditions like stroke and spinal cord injury, virtual reality's ability to manipulate bodily perceptions offers significant therapeutic potential, with reported improvements in upper limb function and gait performance. Balance and gait rehabilitation, especially in older adults, have also seen positive outcomes. The integration of virtual reality with brain-computer interfaces presents exciting possibilities for severe speech and motor impairments. Current research is limited by small sample sizes, short intervention durations, and variability in virtual reality systems. Future studies should focus on larger, long-term trials to confirm findings and explore underlying mechanisms. As virtual reality technology advances, its integration into rehabilitation programs could revolutionize treatment approaches, personalizing treatments, facilitating home training, and potentially improving patient outcomes across a wide variety of conditions.",39253749,10,9,2024

Understanding the pivotal role of gait and balance in daily functionality holds substantial clinical significance, signaling imminent disability and prompting a reevaluation of management approaches. A key priority lies in identifying novel and effective interventions for symptoms that substantially contribute to disability. This paper presents a systematic review that critically examines the existing body of literature on the use of technology in the rehabilitation of older patients with PD. By synthesizing current evidence, we aim to provide insights into the state of the field, identify gaps in knowledge, and offer recommendations for future research and clinical practice. A systematic review of the literature was conducted in September 2023 analyzing manuscripts and papers of the last 5 years from the PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A total of 14 papers were included. The inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) randomized controlled trial, (2) PD in people aged 65 years and older, and (3) use of technology in the rehabilitation training in the older population. A large portion of effective interventions relies on the incorporation of technology, particularly through virtual reality exergames. This technology appears to have effects not only on the cognitive aspect but also on the physical domain. The analysis of the results clearly indicates that, in terms of gait and balance performance, the technological intervention outperforms the traditional approach, irrespective of the specific technology employed. This systematic review seeks to shed light on the evolving landscape of technology-assisted rehabilitation for older individuals with PD. As we delve into the available evidence, we will assess the extent to which technology can serve as a valuable adjunct to conventional therapy, offering new avenues for optimized care and improved outcomes in this growing patient demographic. As we sift through the existing evidence, our goal is to evaluate the potential of technology as a valuable supplement to traditional therapy, presenting fresh opportunities for enhanced care and better outcomes in this expanding patient demographic.",39250193,9,9,2024
Virtual Reality as a Pain Control Adjunct in Orthopedics: A Narrative Review.,"Orthopedic surgeons typically prescribe opioids for postoperative pain management as they are effective in managing pain. However, opioid use can lead to issues such as overdose, prescription excess, inadequate pain management, and addiction. Virtual reality (VR) therapy is an alternative route for postoperative pain management that has grown in popularity over the years. VR therapy involves immersing patients in a virtual 3D experience that is anticipated to alleviate pain. In this review article, we summarized the findings of numerous PubMed studies on the effectiveness of VR therapy for postoperative pain control. VR therapy is beneficial for reducing anxiety, pain, and opioid use after surgical procedures across various specialties. Further studies should explore VR therapy in orthopedic procedures.",39246903,7,8,2024
Effect of video-based interventions on emergence delirium in pediatric patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Emergence delirium is frequently observed in pediatric patients. With advancements in video-based interventions, such as cartoons, video games, and virtual reality, these modalities may contribute to a reduced incidence of emergency delirium among children. However, robust evidence supporting their efficacy remains necessary. The authors conducted a systematic search across multiple databases, including Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library, to identify all randomized controlled trials comparing video-based interventions with control treatments in pediatric emergence delirium. Data were aggregated and analyzed using Review Manager 5.4 to evaluate the effectiveness of video-based interventions. The analysis included eight randomized controlled trials comprising 872 children. The intervention group showed a trend toward lower Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scores (p = 0.10) and fewer emergence delirium events (p = 0.52). Seven studies demonstrated that video-based interventions significantly reduced preoperative anxiety, as indicated by decreased scores on the modified Yale Pre-operative Anxiety Scale (p < 0.00001). Anesthesia duration did not significantly differ between the intervention and control groups (p = 0.16). Notably, subgroup analyses revealed a significant reduction in Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scores among children under seven years of age (p = 0.001). Video-based interventions were linked to lower Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scores and a decreased incidence of emergence delirium events. However, these results did not reach statistical significance across the broader sample. Notably, in children under seven, these interventions significantly reduced the scores.

"Immersive VR movement visualization in patients with hemophilic knee arthropathy: randomized, multicenter, single-blind clinical trial.","To evaluate the efficacy of an immersive movement visualization intervention in patients with hemophilia and hemophilic knee arthropathy. Randomized, single-blind clinical study. Twenty-eight patients with hemophilia were recruited. Patients were randomized to an experimental group (four weeks of immersive movement visualization) and a control group (no intervention). The intensity of pain, pressure pain threshold in the knee, tibialis anterior muscle, lower back level, conditioned pain modulation, range of knee motion, and lower limb functionality were evaluated. There were statistically significant differences in the intergroup effect on knee pain intensity ( F  = 23.71;  p  < 0.001) and lower limb functionality ( F  = 7.11;  p  = 0.003). 42.86% of the patients in the experimental group exhibited changes greater than the minimum detectable change (MDC) in functionality. 39.29% of the patients subject to the intervention experienced changes greater than the MDC in the knee pressure pain threshold. Immersive motion visualization can improve the intensity of joint pain and functionality in patients with hemophilic knee arthropathy. Functionality, pressure pain threshold, and pain intensity improved in those patients who conducted immersive movement visualization.Implications for rehabilitationImmersive visualization of movement significantly improves intensity of joint pain, functionality, pressure pain threshold, joint health, and conditioned pain modulation in patients with hemophilic knee arthropathy.The fact that it is a therapy without potential aversive stimuli makes it a possible access pathway for patients with high levels of kinesiophobia and/or catastrophism.This low-cost, home-based technology allows its use in patients far from hemophilia reference centers or with difficult access to physiotherapy treatments.The immersive visualization of movement influences the democratization of treatment, in accordance with the WHO's Sustainable Development Goal 3 (health and well-being for all).",39244653,8,9,2024
Virtual reality training for radiation safety in cardiac catheterization laboratories - an integrated study.,"The advent of fluoroscopically guided cardiology procedures has greatly improved patient outcomes but has also increased occupational radiation exposure for healthcare professionals, leading to adverse health effects such as radiation-induced cataracts, alopecia, and cancer. This emphasizes the need for effective radiation safety training. Traditional training methods, often based on passive learning, fail to simulate the dynamic catheterization laboratory environment adequately. Virtual Reality (VR) offers a promising alternative by providing immersive, interactive experiences that mimic real-world scenarios without the risks of actual radiation exposure. Our study aims to assess the effectiveness of VR-based radiation safety training compared to traditional methods. We conducted a prospective cohort study involving 48 healthcare professionals in a catheterization lab setting. Participants underwent a 1-hour self-directed VR training session using Virtual Medical Coaching's RadSafe VR software, which simulates real-world clinical scenarios. Pre- and post-intervention radiation dose levels were measured using personal dosimeters at the eye, chest, and pelvis. Knowledge and skills were assessed through tests, and feedback was gathered through surveys and interviews. Statistical analysis revealed significant reductions in radiation exposure across all professional groups after VR training. For cardiologists, the eye dose dropped by 21.88% (from 2.88 mSv to 2.25 mSv), the chest dose decreased by 21.65% (from 4.11 mSv to 3.22 mSv), and the pelvis dose went down by 21.84% (from 2.06 mSv to 1.61 mSv). Perioperative nurses experienced similar reductions, with eye doses decreasing by 14.74% (from 1.56 mSv to 1.33 mSv), chest doses by 26.92% (from 2.6 mSv to 1.9 mSv), and pelvis doses by 26.92% (from 1.3 mSv to 0.95 mSv). Radiographers saw their eye doses reduced by 18.95% (from 0.95 mSv to 0.77 mSv), chest doses by 42.11% (from 1.9 mSv to 1.1 mSv), and pelvis doses by 27.63% (from 0.76 mSv to 0.55 mSv).Participants reported enhanced engagement, improved understanding of radiation safety, and a preference for VR over traditional methods. A cost analysis also demonstrated the economic advantages of VR training, with significant savings in staff time and rental costs compared to traditional methods. Our findings suggest that VR is a highly effective and cost-efficient training tool for radiation safety in healthcare, offering significant benefits over traditional training approaches.",39244378,NA,NA,NA
Hypnosis support in anaesthesia is rarely used in German anaesthesia departments - a nationwide survey among leading physicians of anaesthesia departments.,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether and to what extent perioperative hypnosis and relaxation techniques are used in German anaesthesia departments, what they are, where any difficulties in their application lie and how great the interest in this type of therapy is. Another research question was to find out whether there are specialist areas in which these methods are used more frequently than in other specialist areas. A descriptive survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire in all hospitals with anaesthesia departments in Germany. 1124 questionnaires were sent out by post. The survey period was five months from 27/02/2023 to 31/07/2023. The clinic directors of all anaesthesiology departments in German hospitals were surveyed. 476 departments (42%) responded by pre-paid envelope. Of these, only 39 (8%) use hypnosis and relaxation techniques perioperatively. These are mostly progressive muscle relaxation, hypnotic trance according to Erickson, calming words and suggestions or the use of virtual reality (e.g. using VR-glasses). Hypnosis techniques have been shown in many studies to be effective in increasing patient comfort (less anxiety and stress) and reducing both the need for medication and perioperative pain. The therapy is rarely used in Germany, although once established it can be easily integrated into perioperative procedures. Many departments have shown great interest in the topic. In the interests of patients, a structural change should be considered to promote the use of hypnotic procedures.",39242504,6,9,2024
Feasibility of At-Home Hand Arm Bimanual Intensive Training in Virtual Reality: Case Study.,"This single-participant case study examines the feasibility of using custom virtual reality (VR) gaming software in the home environment for low-dose Hand Arm Bimanual Intensive Training (HABIT). A 10-year-old with right unilateral cerebral palsy participated in this trial. Fine and gross motor skills as well as personal goals for motor outcomes were assessed before and after the intervention using the Box and Blocks Test, Nine-Hole Peg Test, and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Movement intensities collected via the VR hardware accelerometers, VR game scores, and task accuracy were recorded via the HABIT-VR software as indices of motor performance. The child and family were instructed to use the HABIT-VR games twice daily for 30 minutes over a 14-day period and asked to record when they used the system. The child used the system and completed the 14-hour, low-dose HABIT-VR intervention across 22 days. There was no change in Box and Blocks Test and Nine-Hole Peg Test scores before and after the intervention. Canadian Occupational Performance Measure scores increased but did not reach the clinically relevant threshold, due to high scores at baseline. Changes in motor task intensities during the use of VR and mastery of the VR bimanual tasks suggested improved motor efficiency. This case study provides preliminary evidence that HABIT-VR is useful for promoting adherence to HABIT activities and for the maintenance of upper extremity motor skills in the home setting.",39241226,6,9,2024
Twelve-month results for a randomized sham-controlled effectiveness trial of an in-home skills-based virtual reality program for chronic low back pain.,"Low-risk, accessible, and long-term effective nonpharmacologic behavioral interventions for chronic low back pain (cLBP) are needed. Pain education and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are recommended first-line treatments, but access is poor, treatment effectiveness is variable, and long-term effectiveness is inconsistent. In-home virtual reality (VR)-delivered therapies might address these shortcomings because therapeutic content can be delivered in a consistent and quality-controlled manner. To determine whether a 56-session, self-administered in-home, Skills-Based VR program for cLBP (RelieVRx) yields long-term reductions in pain intensity and pain interference 12 months posttreatment in a large demographically diverse and clinically severe real-world sample. Participants were 1,093 demographically diverse individuals with self-reported nonmalignant cLBP >3 months duration and average pain intensity and interference scores >4/10. Participants were randomized to Skills-Based VR or active Sham, and data were collected from January 31, 2022 to October 31, 2023. Pretreatment to 12-month posttreatment analyses were conducted. From baseline to 12 months posttreatment, Skills-Based VR reductions for average pain intensity (1.7 ± 2.1) and pain interference (1.9 ± 2.3) were robust and significantly greater than those found for Sham. More than half of Skills-Based VR participants reported at least a 2-point reduction in pain intensity, pain interference, or both at 12 months posttreatment. A standardized, in-home Skills-Based VR therapy is effective for reducing pain intensity and pain interference, and these effects are maintained to 12 months posttreatment.",39239633,4,9,2024
The efficacy of virtual reality-based rehabilitation in improving motor function in patients with stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Stroke is a major cause of adult disability, prompting the exploration of innovative rehabilitation methods. Virtual rehabilitation (VR), leveraging technological advances, has gained popularity as a treatment for stroke recovery. The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English within the last decade, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. The authors searched databases such as Medline/PubMed, and the Cochrane Library using specific search keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). The methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale, focusing on RCTs involving adult stroke patients undergoing VR rehabilitation, with outcomes related to motor function and quality of life. The authors included 15 studies in our meta-analysis. VR rehabilitation offers several advantages over traditional therapy, such as enhanced feedback and increased patient motivation. Engaging VR environments helps improve focus during treatment, potentially boosting recovery from post-stroke impairments. VR therapies significantly benefit motor function, which can improve activities of daily living and overall quality of life. VR has demonstrated efficacy in improving motor function and quality of life for stroke survivors. Future research should explore patient variability and refine intervention methods. Incorporating VR into rehabilitation programs could optimize stroke recovery outcomes.",39238962,2,8,2024
Therapist perspectives on telehealth-based virtual reality exposure therapy.,"Virtual reality (VR) can enhance mental health care. In particular, the effectiveness of VR-based exposure therapy (VRET) has been well-demonstrated for treatment of anxiety disorders. However, most applications of VRET remain localized to clinic spaces. We aimed to explore mental health therapists' perceptions of telehealth-based VRET (tele-VRET) by conducting semi-structured, qualitative interviews with 18 telemental health therapists between October and December 2022. Interview topics included telehealth experiences, exposure therapy over telehealth, previous experiences with VR, and perspectives on tele-VRET. Therapists described how telehealth reduced barriers (88.9%, 16/18), enhanced therapy (61.1%, 11/18), and improved access to clients (38.9%, 7/18), but entailed problems with technology (61.1%, 11/18), uncontrolled settings (55.6%, 10/18), and communication difficulties (50%, 9/18). Therapists adapted exposure therapy to telehealth by using online resources (66.7%, 12/18), preparing client expectations (55.6%, 10/18), and adjusting workflows (27.8%, 5/18). Most therapists had used VR before (72.2%, 13/18) and had positive impressions of VR (55.6%, 10/18), but none had used VR clinically. In response to tele-VRET, therapists requested interactive session activities (77.8%, 14/18) and customizable interventions components (55.6%, 10/18). Concerns about tele-VRET included risks with certain clients (77.8%, 14/18), costs (50%, 9/18), side effects and privacy (22.2%, 4/18), and inappropriateness for specific forms of exposure therapy (16.7%, 3/18). These results reveal how combining telehealth and VRET may expand therapeutic options for mental healthcare providers and can help inform collaborative development of immersive health technologies.",39238767,8,3,2024
Enhancing Dynamic Balance and Postural Stability in Stroke Patients: The Impact of Immersive Virtual Reality Training.,"Introduction Stroke is a major neurological event resulting from reduced or blocked blood flow to the brain, leading to significant morbidity. Immediate medical attention is essential to minimize brain damage and improve outcomes since it leads to many clinical deficits like locomotor impairment, instability in postural control, tonic alterations of the affected musculature, and an array of neurological dysfunctions if left unnoticed. Immersive virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a novel therapeutic tool in stroke rehabilitation, offering engaging and realistic environments for therapy. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of immersive VR training combined with functional gait exercises in improving dynamic balance and postural stability in stroke patients, compared to VR training alone. Methods This comparative study included 30 subjects from Madha Medical College and Hospital, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, divided into two groups. Group A (n=15) received immersive VR combined with functional gait exercises, while Group B (n=15) received immersive VR alone. Subjects were aged 40-60 years with stable blood pressure and a stroke duration of two weeks to six months. The study spanned 12 weeks, with 30-minute sessions on alternate days. Dynamic balance and postural stability were assessed using the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) and Falls Efficacy Scale (FES). Pre-test and post-test scores were evaluated using parametric tests. Results Post-test mean values showed significant improvements in both groups. Group A demonstrated greater effectiveness, with lower FES scores (mean 36.66 ± 11.12) than Group B (mean 46.66 ± 9.75). FGA scores were higher in Group A (mean 28.00 ± 0.925) compared to Group B (mean 26.06 ± 1.66). Significant differences were observed in pre-test and post-test values within each group, supporting the hypothesis that combined VR and gait exercises offer superior rehabilitation outcomes. Conclusions Immersive VR combined with functional gait exercises significantly improves dynamic balance and postural stability in stroke patients compared to VR alone. This integrated approach can enhance motor function recovery, increase independence, and improve the quality of life. VR's capability to simulate real-life activities and provide immediate feedback allows for personalized rehabilitation programs. Further research is required to validate these findings and optimize VR-based rehabilitation protocols.",39238751,6,8,2024
[Effect of different intervention measures on duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of ICU stay in critically ill patients: a network Meta-analysis].,"To evaluate the effects of different intervention measures on duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay in critically ill patients using network Meta-analysis. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the effects of different intervention measures on duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of ICU stay in critically ill patients were systematically searched in PubMed, Embase, China Biomedical Literature Database, CNKI, and other databases. The search time limit was from the establishment of the database to November 2023. Literature screening, quality assessment, and data extraction were independently conducted by two researchers. Network Meta-analysis was employed to assess the effects of each intervention on duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of ICU stay, and funnel plots were generated. A total of 37 RCTs were included, involving 3 977 severe patients, 2 041 in the intervention group and 1 936 in the control group. Thirteen types of interventions were analyzed, including usual care (UC), early activity (EA), early comprehensive rehabilitation (ECR), early pulmonary rehabilitation (EPR), cluster intervention strategy (CS), sedation, analgesia and cluster nursing (SACN), music therapy (MT), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), modified education and visitation (MV), virtual reality (VR), auricular point sticking (APS), acupoint acupuncture (AA), and concerted intervention (COR). Network Meta-analysis showed that MV significantly better than COR [standardized mean difference (SMD) = -2.35, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was -4.30 to -0.39], EPR (SMD = -2.59, 95%CI was -4.81 to -0.37), and UC (SMD = -4.10, 95%CI was -5.71 to -2.49) in improving duration of mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients. COR was significantly better than UC in shortened length of ICU stay (SMD = -5.72, 95%CI was -10.07 to -1.37). The efficacy ranking results showed that for duration of mechanical ventilation, the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was highest for MV (85.4%) and EA (85.4%), followed by AA (74.9%), NMES (63.1%), ECR (51.7%), CS (48.8%), SACN (34.3%), COR (29.4%), EPR (26.1%), and UC (0.7%). For the length of ICU stay, COR had the highest SUCRA (82.3%), followed by APS (79.7%), MV (77.7%), EPR (68.0%), NMES (57.6%), CS (54.4%), ECR (51.1%), SACN (41.9%), MT (39.8%), EA (39.3%), AA (33.0%), VR (15.4%), and UC (9.8%). The funnel plot results of ICU stay showed that the publication bias between studies were relatively small. MV and COR appear to be effective interventions for reducing mechanical ventilation time and ICU stay in critically ill patients. However, due to the number and quality of included studies, these findings require confirmation through additional high-quality research.",39238411,NA,NA,NA
3D virtual models and augmented reality for radical prostatectomy: a narrative review.,"The increasing popularity of three-dimensional (3D) virtual reconstructions of two-dimensional (2D) imaging in urology has led to significant technological advancements, resulting in the creation of highly accurate 3D virtual models (3DVMs) that faithfully replicate individual anatomical details. This technology enhances surgical reality, providing surgeons with hyper-accurate insights into instantaneous subjective surgical anatomy and improving preoperative surgical planning. In the uro-oncologic field, the utility of 3D virtual reconstruction has been demonstrated in nephron-sparing surgery, impacting surgical strategy and postoperative outcomes in prostate cancer (PCa). The aim of this study is to offer a thorough narrative review of the current state and application of 3D reconstructions and augmented reality (AR) in radical prostatectomy (RP). A non-systematic literature review was conducted using Medline, PubMed, the Cochrane Database, and Embase to gather information on clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, review articles, and prospective and retrospective studies related to 3DVMs and AR in RP. The search strategy followed the PICOS (Patients, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Study design) criteria and was performed in January 2024. The adoption of 3D visualization has become widespread, with applications ranging from preoperative planning to intraoperative consultations. The urological community's interest in intraoperative surgical navigation using cognitive, virtual, mixed, and AR during RP is evident in a substantial body of literature, including 16 noteworthy investigations. These studies highlight the varied experiences and benefits of incorporating 3D reconstructions and AR into RP, showcasing improvements in preoperative planning, intraoperative navigation, and real-time decision-making. The integration of 3DVMs and AR technologies in urological oncology, particularly in the context of RP, has shown promising advancements. These technologies provide crucial support in preoperative planning, intraoperative navigation, and real-time decision-making, significantly improving the visualization of complex anatomical structures helping in the nerve sparing (NS) approach modulation and reducing positive surgical margin (PSM) rate. Despite positive outcomes, challenges such as small patient cohorts, lack of standardized methodologies, and concerns about costs and technology adoption persist.",39238344,NA,NA,NA
Intermittent theta burst stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has no additional effect on the efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy for acrophobia. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study.,"Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental disorders. Treatment guidelines recommend pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy as standard treatment. Although cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective therapeutic approach, not all patients benefit sufficiently from it. In recent years, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, have been investigated as promising adjuncts in the treatment of affective disorders. The aim of this study is to investigate whether a combination of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) and virtual reality exposure therapy leads to a significantly greater reduction in acrophobia than virtual reality exposure with sham stimulation. In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, 43 participants with acrophobia received verum or sham iTBS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex prior to two sessions of virtual reality exposure therapy. Stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with iTBS was motivated by an experimental study showing a positive effect on extinction memory retention. Acrophobic symptoms were assessed using questionnaires and two behavioral approach tasks one week before, after treatment and six months after the second diagnostic session. The results showed that two sessions of virtual reality exposure therapy led to a significant reduction in acrophobic symptoms, with an overall remission rate of 79 %. However, there was no additional effect of iTBS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on the therapeutic effects. Further research is needed to determine how exactly a combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation and exposure therapy should be designed to enhance efficacy.",39236930,3,9,2024
Transorbital Approach Clipping of Middle Cerebral Artery Aneurysm: A Virtual Reality Morphometric Anatomic Study.,"The transorbital approach (TOA) has a unique advantage to the more common lateral approaches as it provides direct access to the anterior middle fossa and medial sylvian fissure (SF) without significant dissection or retraction. However, when to use the TOA for surgical treatment of middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms remains unclear. This study details the feasibility of clipping unruptured MCA aneurysms via the TOA by highlighting the anatomic features that either facilitate or hinder the approach. Virtual reality (VR) models of 25 MCA aneurysms from computed tomography angiograms of actual patients were rendered with the relevant anatomic structures, including the neighboring temporal lobe and SF. TOA was performed on the models in VR and the globe was translated medially and inferiorly, replicating retraction used intraoperatively. Anatomic data, including the area of surgical freedom (AOF) at the aneurysm, were recorded. Trials of aneurysm clipping were conducted in VR and each aneurysm was classified as ""possible"" or ""impossible"" candidates for clipping via TOA. Separately, the relationship between surgical view and SF visualized was analyzed. Sixteen aneurysms were eliminated as candidates for TOA treatment either through VR clip trial and/or because the SF was inaccessible. The remaining 9 (36%) were candidates for TOA. Comparing the details of these 2 aneurysm categories with Mann Whitney U tests, there was a statistically significant difference in the AOF of the TOA approach and the width of the aneurysm dome. A clinical case report is also provided highlighting the VR rehearsal similarity with surgery. Given the minimally invasive, technically challenging approach, the feasibility and safety of TOA for MCA aneurysms must be evaluated before wide clinical adoption. This study identified AOF, aneurysm width, and SF accessibility as three features that may significantly impact the possibility of clipping MCA aneurysms via TOA.",39236805,3,9,2024
Innovative technology-based interventions in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Novel technology-based interventions have the potential to improve motor symptoms and gait in Parkinson's disease (PD). Promising treatments include virtual-reality (VR) training, robotic assistance, and biofeedback. Their effectiveness remains unclear, and thus, we conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis. We searched the Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases until 2 April 2024 and only included randomized controlled trials. Outcomes included changes in UPDRS-III/MDS-UPDRS-III score, stride length, 10-meter walk test (10MWT), timed up-and-go (TUG) test, balance scale scores and quality-of-life (QoL) scores. Results were reported as mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD), with 95% credible intervals (95% CrI). Fifty-one randomized controlled trials with 2095 patients were included. For UPDRS (motor outcome), all interventions had similar efficacies. VR intervention was the most effective in improving TUG compared with control (MD: -4.36, 95% CrI: -8.57, -0.35), outperforming robotic, exercise, and proprioceptive interventions. Proprioceptive intervention significantly improved stride length compared to control intervention (MD: 0.11 m, 95% CrI: 0.03, 0.19), outperforming VR, robotic and exercise interventions. Virtual reality improved balance scale scores significantly compared to exercise intervention (SMD: 0.75, 95% CrI: 0.12, 1.39) and control intervention (SMD: 1.42, 95% CrI: 0.06, 2.77). Virtual reality intervention significantly improved QoL scores compared to control intervention (SMD: -0.95, 95% CrI: -1.43, -0.52), outperforming Internet-based interventions. VR-based and proprioceptive interventions were the most promising interventions, consistently ranking as the top treatment choices for most outcomes. Their use in clinical practice could be helpful in managing motor symptoms and QoL in PD.",39236299,5,9,2024

Shaping corticospinal pathways in virtual reality: effects of task complexity and sensory feedback during mirror therapy in neurologically intact individuals.,"Restoration of limb function for individuals with unilateral weakness typically requires volitional muscle control, which is often not present for individuals with severe impairment. Mirror therapy-interventions using a mirror box to reflect the less-impaired limb onto the more-impaired limb-can facilitate corticospinal excitability, leading to enhanced recovery in severely impaired clinical populations. However, the mirror box applies limitations on mirror therapy, namely that all movements appear bilateral and are confined to a small area, impeding integration of complex activities and multisensory feedback (e.g., visuo-tactile stimulation). These limitations can be addressed with virtual reality, but the resulting effect on corticospinal excitability is unclear. Examine how virtual reality-based unilateral mirroring, complex activities during mirroring, and visuo-tactile stimulation prior to mirroring affect corticospinal excitability. Participants with no known neurological conditions (n = 17) donned a virtual reality system (NeuRRoVR) that displayed a first-person perspective of a virtual avatar that matched their motions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor evoked potentials in the nondominant hand muscles were used to evaluate corticospinal excitability in four conditions: resting, mirroring, mirroring with prior visuo-tactile stimulation (mirroring + TACT), and control. During mirroring, the movements of each participant's dominant limb were reflected onto the nondominant limb of the virtual avatar, and the avatar's dominant limb was kept immobile (i.e., unilateral mirroring). The mirroring + TACT condition was the same as the mirroring condition, except that mirroring was preceded by visuo-tactile stimulation of the nondominant limb. During the control condition, unilateral mirroring was disabled. During all conditions, participants performed simple (flex/extend fingers) and complex (stack virtual blocks) activities. We found that unilateral mirroring increased corticospinal excitability compared to no mirroring (p < 0.001), complex activities increased excitability compared to simple activities during mirroring (p < 0.001), and visuo-tactile stimulation prior to mirroring decreased excitability (p = 0.032). We also found that these features did not interact with each other. The findings of this study shed light onto the neurological mechanisms of mirror therapy and demonstrate the unique ways in which virtual reality can augment mirror therapy. The findings have important implications for rehabilitation for design of virtual reality systems for clinical populations.",39232841,4,9,2024
Novel non-pharmacological strategies for managing dentophobia in adult patients - literature review.,"Dentophobia concerns a substantial portion of the adult population, often leading to avoidance of dental care and subsequent deterioration in oral health. This comprehensive review explores the multifaceted nature of odontophobia and examines various non-pharmacological strategies aimed at its management in adult patients. Factors contributing to dentophobia, including past traumatic experiences, feelings of vulnerability, and mistrust in dental professionals, are discussed, highlighting the complex interplay of psychological, physiological, and environmental influences. Novel approaches such as Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy offer promising avenues for systematically desensitising patients to their fears and enhancing treatment acceptance. Aromatherapy utilising essential oils like chamomile, orange, and lavender, as well as dog-assisted therapy, have shown potential in creating calming environments and reducing patient anxiety during dental procedures. Muscle relaxation therapy, biofeedback techniques, and process simulations provide additional tools for addressing the physiological and cognitive aspects of odontophobia. Cognitive-behavioural therapy interventions, including brief sessions focused on cognitive restructuring and exposure therapy, demonstrate efficacy in reducing fear of dentists and improving treatment outcomes. By incorporating these diverse non-pharmacological strategies into dental practice, clinicians can enhance patient experiences, increase treatment acceptance and adherence, and ultimately improve oral health outcomes. While these interventions show promising results, further research is needed to refine their implementation, optimize their effectiveness, and ensure accessibility to patients with dentophobia. By addressing the multifaceted nature of dental anxiety and adopting a patient-centred approach, clinicians can provide holistic care, fostering better oral health and overall well-being in their patients.",39231334,NA,NA,NA
Digital motor intervention effects on physical activity performance of individuals with developmental disabilities: a systematic review.,"Post-pandemic, use of digital technologies (e.g., mobile app, Zoom, virtual reality, and videogaming) to promote physical activity (PA) in populations with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) has increased. The efficacy of various digital technologies in promoting PA in individuals with IDD varies. We conducted a systematic review to examine current literature findings on the efficacy of digital PA interventions on PA outcomes in individuals with IDD. Articles published between 1900 and 2024 that examined effects of technology-based PA interventions on PA levels/fitness of individuals with IDD using experimental or quasi-experimental study designs were included. Sixteen articles were retrieved from four health databases PubMed (914), PsycInfo (1201), SCOPUS (1910), and CINAHL (948). Findings based on 604 participants (Autism: 383; Down Syndrome: 106; Developmental Disability: 83, Developmental Coordination Disorder: 37) provide the most support for exergaming/digital PA intervention benefits for populations with ID, Down Syndrome, and Autism; however, there was limited support for its use in those without ID (e.g., DCD). Digital technology is an effective tool to promote improvements in PA/fitness, motor, cardiovascular performance in individuals with ID. Future studies need to build on this evidence to support the use of PA outcomes in individuals with different IDD diagnoses.",39229783,4,9,2024
