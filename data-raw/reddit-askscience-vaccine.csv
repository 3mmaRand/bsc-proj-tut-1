2021-08-11,1628671349,What happen when an infected cell replicate itself ?,"Hi, 

So what i'd like to know is this, if a cell is infected by a virus or """"infected"""" with mRNA from vaccine for example. What would happen if the cell replicate ? Would the new cells contain the virus or mRNA ? 

I'm thinking about this cause when you do workout you accelerate the replication process (I suppose since cells have to repair the part that you broke in your muscle during the workout). And since the vaccine is injected in the muscle I was questioning myself about that. 

Like, if it was the case, could it cause chain reaction, cells replicating with the virus again and again ? Maybe it's totally stupid tbh.",askscience,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/p292wb/what_happen_when_an_infected_cell_replicate_itself/
2020-10-07,1602063010,Are vaccine platforms reusable?,"I'm reading about vaccines and came across a vaccine that is based on the Adenovirus 26. To the best of my knowledge this means that after vaccination the immune system learns to defeat this adonovirus and because of the modification also learns to render the spikes on the corona virus useless. Of course I'm using layman terms here.

If someone is vaccinated with this vaccine and a different virus comes along, can this platform still be used for this new virus?",askscience,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/j6nu5w/are_vaccine_platforms_reusable/

Every year, [more than 300,000 people worldwide die from complications related to seasonal influenza](https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/surveillance-and-monitoring/burden-of-disease). Even though the yearly flu shot [reduces infections, decreases hospitalizations and prevents thousands of deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/vaccineeffect.htm), there is clearly more work to be done. Further complicating things is that many of the typical symptoms of flu overlap with symptoms of COVID-19, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection and the common cold.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (19 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), about seasonal and pandemic influenza. We'll answer your questions about why we need a different flu shot every year, talk about the process of identifying, making and delivering the flu vaccine, and discuss strategies for minimizing (and hopefully preventing) the spread of influenza.

The WHO has also acknowledged that additional support will be needed for manufacturers who currently only make quadrivalent vaccines to pivot to making trivalent vaccines.

However, my question is -- if we're already prepared to produce quadrivalent vaccines, why don't we take the ""slot"" opened by B/Yamagata to immunize for a third variety of Influenza A?

We're a group of students, professors &amp; staff connected to the University of Washington's MolE Institute. AUA about MolE!","We are graduate students, staff, and faculty from the University of Washington Molecular Engineering and Science (MolES) Institute. Molecular Engineering is a new field; we were one of the first Molecular Engineering graduate programs in the world, and one of only two in the United States. Though MolES only opened in 2014, we have had many discoveries to share!

Molecular engineering itself is a broad and evolving field that seeks to understand how molecular properties and interactions can be manipulated to design and assemble better materials, systems, and processes for specific functions. Any time you attempt to change the object-level behavior of something by precisely altering it on the molecular level - given knowledge of how molecules in that ""something"" interacts with one another - you're engaging in a type of molecular engineering. The applications are endless! Some specific examples of Molecular Engineering research being done within the labs of the MolES Institute are:

1. MolES faculty member and Chemistry professor Al Nelson developed a new way to produce medicines and chemicals and preserve them in portable, modular ""biofactories"" embedded in water-based gels known as hydrogels. This approach could enable access to critical medicines and other compounds in low-resource areas.
2. The Baker lab in MolES and Biochemistry is engineering artificial proteins to self-assemble on a crystal surface. The ability to program these interactions could enable the design of new biomimetic materials with customized chemical reactivity or mechanical properties, that can serve as scaffolds for nano-filters, solar cells or electronic circuits.
3. Bioengineering/MolES Institute Professor Kelly Stevens developed a new 3D printing approach to create biocompatible hydrogels with life-like vasculature - opening the possibility of printing living human tissue for things like organ replacement!
4. Researchers in MolES and Chemical Engineering professor Elizabeth Nance's lab are attempting to deliver therapeutics to the brain using tiny nanoparticles that can effectively cross the blood-brain-barrier in brain injury and disease.
5. MolES PhD student Jason Fontana is working in the labs of James Carothers and Jesse Zalatan to develop tools that facilitate genetic engineering in bacteria for optimizing biosynthesis of valuable products.

Molecular engineering is recognized by the National Academy of Engineering as one of the areas of education and research most critical to ensuring the future economic, environmental and medical health of the U.S. As a highly interdisciplinary field spanning across the science and engineering space, students of Molecular Engineering have produced numerous impactful scientific discoveries. We specifically believe that Molecular Engineering could be an exciting avenue for up-and-coming young scientists, and thus we would like to further general awareness of our discipline!

2021-05-20,1621547524,mRNA vaccines: what become the LNPs that cross the BBB (blood-brain-barrier)?,"Hello.

It seems that the LNPs (lipid nanoparticles) that contain the mRNA of Covid-19 vaccines from BioNTech and Moderna do - at low doses - pass the BBB. This is mentioned by the [EMA](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/comirnaty-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf) several times in their report, for example p. 54 and discussed [in the comments of an article on Derek Lowe's blog](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/11/rna-vaccines-and-their-lipids#comment-336216).

If that's indeed the case, what would happen once the mRNA + nanolipid reach the brain? Which cells would pick up the LNPs and for how long would they stay in the brain? If there is cells that can transform this mRNA in proteins, where will these proteins then go, and for how long will they stay in the brain? What about the LNPs: what can/will the brain do with the remaining lipids?

Edit: any difference between Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech on that front? Their lipid (SM-102 in Moderna's mRNA-1273 and Acuitas ALC-0315 in Pfizer/BioNTech's Cominarty) have strong [similarities](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/1/65), but they are not exactly the same.

Join us today at 2 PM ET for a discussion with vaccine and immunology experts, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). We'll answer questions on how the current COVID vaccines work (and what the differences are between the different vaccines), what sort of protection the vaccine(s) offer against current, emerging and future strains of the virus, and how the various vaccine platforms used to develop the COVID vaccines can be used to fight against future diseases.

After a successful career in computers, software and the Internet, I retired to become a Silicon Valley Angel Investor. Retirement didnt last long& I met Dr. Roscoe Brady at the National Institutes of Health and he showed me something that I immediately realized would be bigger than computers or the Internet ever became. In 2006, Dr. Brady opened my eyes to viral vectors and genetic technologies that I realized could let me reprogram the fundamental computers of life itself: the human cell. That ah-ha moment back in 2006 began my quest to solve intractable human disease by repairing the underlying genetic roots of cancers, inherited disorders and infectious disease. Now, I head a leading genetic technologies company that is going to help send chemotherapy and radiation for cancer the way of leeches and bloodletting, and provide treatments and cures for scores of formally un-addressable disorders and diseases.

TL;DR - Silicon Valley sweetheart turned genetic drug developer


The Activator - My name is David Pauza, an OG (original gene cloner) since the 1970s. My areas of expertise are human virology and cancer. For the last 30 years or so, I have been studying HIV / AIDS, publishing scientific papers and educating the public about viral diseases. Before joining AGT, I had started an HIV research program at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, then built a strong HIV program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and finally moved to the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. During those years my lab group focused on understanding the most basic steps in HIV disease and designing new treatments or vaccines. We first talked openly of curing HIV disease in 1992 and have kept that flame burning ever since. The path to a cure depended on studying fundamental aspects of human virology and immunology. Many of the lessons learned in our study of AIDS apply directly to human cancer, which continues to be a major threat to HIV+ people even with current therapy. I brought these perspectives, skills and some team members to American Gene Technologies where we are working with Jeff to chart innovative cures for major human diseases.


TL;DR - A scientist with deep knowledge and a big bag of tricks.


As we see it, the new frontier of drug development is genetic science, where rifle-shot treatments deal with the specific, underlying causes of disease, eventually leading to cures rather than lifetime treatments. We take a creative approach, believing that many diseases can be treated with genetic therapy if you mix the right technology with a solid understanding of disease and add advice from talented clinicians to guide treatment delivery.


We are currently focusing on HIV / AIDS, Liver Cancer, Phenylketonuria (PKU) and Breast Cancer. Ask us anything about our mission, gene therapy basics, new technology, research, development portfolio or the future!

2021-08-02,1627909383,Why are adverse reactions to vaccines more common in younger people than older people?,"I was looking through the adverse reactions to the COVID vaccines, and I found it interesting that the CDC report that younger people are more likely to experience (or at the very least report) an adverse reaction to the COVID vaccines than if you were older. I would have thought it would be the opposite (due to older people having weaker immune systems)? Can someone explain this phenomenon? Is this something of all vaccines? What's the biological mechanism here?

Refer to table 1 of [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7008e3.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7008e3.htm): 64.9% of 18 to 49 report an adverse reaction. I thought perhaps it was to do with unequal category sizes (18 to 49, versus say 50 to 64), but I don't think it is as this represents 2/3 of the total.

P.S. I really don't want to get into a debate about whether or not people should take the vaccine or not (I think people at risk, definitely should). I simply want to understand why vaccines effect different age groups in different ways.

I'm particularly interested in the case where your body easily defeats an exposure to Omicron due to a large abundance of antibodies from a recent booster.

The other subset (non-inflammatory PASC) is a bit more mysterious as the blood signature is a little less obvious. However, even in this group, we find evidence of ongoing antiviral responses and immune-related mediators of lung fibrosis which may give some hints at common pathways of pathology.

To that end, we recently collaborated on [a list of design principles](https://medium.com/swlh/it-matters-how-platforms-label-manipulated-media-here-are-12-principles-designers-should-follow-438b76546078) platforms should follow when labeling misinformation in media, such as manipulated images and video. We're here to answer your questions on misinformation: manipulation tactics, risks of misinformation, media and platform moderation, and how science professionals can counter misinformation.

We'll start at 1pm ET (10am PT, 17 UT), AUA!

Ask Us Anything!","With the COVID-19 pandemic still going strong after almost 2 years, it's clear that we need more than vaccines to help stop the spread of the virus. In a study published last week in Science Advances, our interdisciplinary team of researchers found, to our surprise, that cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid produced by the cannabis plant, can prevent replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in human cells in a dish, and that mice who are pre-treated with CBD shower lower rates of infection when exposed to the virus. We also looked at real-world data collected from patients who were taking a medically prescribed CBD solution for the treatment of epilepsy and found that they tested positive for COVID-19 at significantly lower rates than similar patients who were not taking CBD. All together, we feel this provides compelling evidence that CBD could be a prophylactic treatment to prevent COVID-19, or even a treatment that could be used in the early stages of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We are now hoping to launch clinical trials on the topic.

2020-11-24,1606184209,Which cells do the protein synthesis from the mRNA of vaccines?,"One thing that I'm a bit fuzzy on are the specifics of mRNA vaccine protein synthesis because all explanations I've read of the process simply refer to a really generic ambiguous ""host cell"" that does the protein synthesis after it absorbes the mRNA from the vaccine.

1. mRNA (packaged in things like liposomes) is injected into the host.


2. These liposomes bind with host cells, the mRNA enters, and the host cell ribosomes synthesize proteins based off of the vaccine mRNA and presents these proteins on the outside of their walls. *Do all kinds of cells uptake the vaccine mRNA and synthesize this protein? ie. the vaccine mRNA will be taken up by an assortment of epithelial cells, lymphocytes, myocytes, etc. and each of these will synthesize proteins based on the mRNA.*

Or do we completely get rid of viruses when we recover from them?","I have a high school level biological sciences education and have studied mostly computer science since then.  I'm given to understand that some people can be asymptomatic carriers of viruses and I want to understand how this works. From what I understand,

* Immunocompromised patients, e.g. those with AIDS, die due to causes other than HIV because their body is not able to fight other viruses, like influenza. When this happens, have they contracted influenza externally, or were these viruses in their body waiting to strike?
* Though I am vaccinated, I may be an asymptomatic carrier of COVID and should be careful out in public places.

But I also thought,

* Viruses start replicating in your body, literally fill up cells and explode outwards, killing cells. This is how they reproduce, so some cells would always need to either be dying, or keep producing some small amount of the virus, but not enough to kill them, to keep some level of the virus in our body.

So, how does this work? Am I still carrying the influenza variant from the last time I got the flu? I am not currently sick with the flu.

Is HIV being used or is that misleading?

Also from the same site, [an article about how it's not exactly measles that is being used to help cure cancer](http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2014/05/16/could-measles-cure-cancer-uh-not-exactly/) which points out how it's not really measles or the vaccine that is being used. Assuming the site is a good site to get information, this seems like a common problem with the general public. Do any professionals have to deal with this or realize how much misinformation there is out there? What ways is there to counter mainstream media misinformation (this might be a question for another forum though)?

I bring this up, because I am currently going back and forth with a user about this and want to make sure that I'm not backing incorrect information.

Thank you.

I should point out that I don't think /r/stoned_shaman actually believes this anymore as they were following this thread.

I don't exactly know what I thought before this point, but I think it was close to the same (the virus in full, but disabled somehow...

2023-06-12,1686543618,AskSciences concerns regarding Reddits API changes,"In April 2023, [Reddit announced they would begin charging for its application programming interface (API)
access](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/technology/reddit-ai-openai-google.html).

API is used to allow different applications to interact with each other. We are a heavily moderated subreddit, and we use API access for moderation, AMA organisation, and insights into our community. We are using community-driven tools which use the API in order to make management of a community as large as /r/askscience practical for our group of volunteer moderators.

At the same time, we recognise both Reddit's mission as a corporation, as well as the dangers and risks arising from access to the API. Reddit is looking for ways to [monetize its user-generated content](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/upcoming-reddit-blackout-and-future-third-party-applications); the Times article linked above notes has been used to train high-profile machine learning models like OpenAI's.

While Reddit administration has mentioned [free access for moderation tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/), we believe their current approach of gatekeeping access based on arbitrary and indiscriminate rate limiting has several shortcomings:  
It disproportionately impacts people who use Reddit with accommodations, such as screen readers: Reddit has stated that [accessibility-focused apps will be exempt from the new restrictions](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/reddit-makes-an-exception-for-accessibility-apps-under-new-api-terms/) but has offered little clarity on what that means for this rapidly-approaching change  
It does not reflect Reddits promise to [support moderation
  tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/)  
It does not establish clear and concise criteria for what is legitimate API usage  

We also remain cognisant of Reddits past promises to [improve communication with
moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cbo4m/we_apologize/) and build tools for us to improve search and combat hateful rhetoric, anti-vaccination, and COVID denialism. While Reddit has banned hate speech and banned communities spreading science denialism, we feel they have not delivered on moderation tools and support. We feel that 3rd-party tools still offer superior support for moderation as well as accessibility features.

Everyone in the /r/askscience community contributes to its quality and longevity by volunteering their time and expertise to question, answer, and moderate scientific discussion. We feel the Reddit administration does a disservice our passion for large-scale, high-quality science communication by [pursuing a unilateral and opaque
direction](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/). This damages our community and ultimately Reddit itself by severing the trust we place upon it as a platform for science education and outreach.

Particles of virus can float for up to 2 hours after an infected person passes through a room. People are contagious for 4 days before they have a rash and about 4 days after they get the rash. Because it's so easy to catch, about 95% of a population has to be vaccinated against the measles to stop it from spreading. In 2017, the latest year for which data are available, only 91.5% of toddlers in the U.S. were vaccinated, according to the CDC.

2020-02-26,1582758166,"What does it take to develop a vaccine, and why does it take so long?","My basic understanding is that a vaccine contains a weakened or dead version of the virus in question, which can be injected into the body so the immune system can develop antibodies without risk of infection. The vaccine acts as a practice run of sorts.

What exactly is it that stops us from just getting a sample of the virus and, say, irradiating it with x-rays or dunking it in some sort of virus-killer chemical (if such a thing exists)? Do we have to figure out how to weaken each virus on a case-by-case basis?

I know there obviously must be some reason, and its not as simple as just *bake virus for 15 minutes, until golden brown*. Otherwise disease just wouldnt be an issue, and thats obviously not the case. Im wondering what makes it so hard.

Edit: Thank you for the answers everyone! To sum things up: its complicated! (Who knew?)

In addition, preliminary clinical trial data about the successful performance of other candidates has also been released. While these announcements have caused great excitement, a certain amount of caution and perspective are needed to discern what this news actually means for potentially ending the worst global health pandemic in a century in sight.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (19 UT) for a discussion with vaccine and immunology experts, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). We'll answer questions about the approved vaccines, what the clinical trial results mean (and don't mean), and how the approval processes have worked. We'll also discuss what other vaccine candidates are in the pipeline, and whether the first to complete the clinical trials will actually be the most effective against this disease. Finally, we'll talk about what sort of timeline we should expect to return to normalcy, and what the process will be like for distributing and vaccinating the world's population. Ask us anything!

This is not being done, so either:

* the virus does infect muscle tissue
* the virus is not infectious enough in muscle tissue to trigger an immune response
* the virus would reach the respiratory tract too quickly from the injection site

2021-03-14,1615704718,"After having Covid, your body retains antibodies against it for only a short period of time. Why does the body essentially ""forget"" these antibodies?","For other viruses and diseases, the body seems to remember its antibodies and resistances for much longer periods of time, if not indefinitely. What makes Covid so different that the body loses its antibodies for it after a relatively short period (roughly 90 days, iirc). Is it due to a function of the virus and its mutative nature, or is it a function of the body itself?

And as a side question, what does the vaccine do that allows the body to keep these tolerances and antibodies longer?

EDIT: Thanks for all the helpful responses! I don't know very much at all about how viruses work and the amount of information here about antibody lifespans, how the immune system creates them, and the miscommunications by the media regarding how immunity functions has been quite eye opening. I wish I would have worded the title better, but at least there's now plenty of responses to illuminate the error there as well!",askscience,361,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/m4q2m9/after_having_covid_your_body_retains_antibodies/

2021-02-05,1612514459,Are the vaccine efficacies for COVID vaccines able to be directly compared?,"First,  sorry I missed the AMA (UK based so time zone issues) hopefully someone can comment. My question: We have all heard the quoted 95% for e.g Pfizer and 70% effective for Oxford vaccines.  But it looked to me like the underlying study outputs and processes make those numbers completely incomparable. For example,  Pfizer only tested to confirm  (by PCR)  symptomatic patients,  whilst Oxford tested (at least in the UK cohort) weekly regardless of symptoms,  and as a result picked up a huge number of asymptomatic infections (almost half of the UK infections seen in the study) and included those in calculating its 70% figure.  Surely this means that on a comparable basis the Pfizer efficacy would be much lower? How can we compare them?

EDIT: a number of commenters have pointed out that my question was in fact based on a misunderstanding (I think based on the UK study report alone and not the pooled data article),  and that the Oxford efficacy calculation  appears to have only looked at the symptomatic cases so they are actually more comparable than I had realised. 

Thanks to those commenters.

The quote from the Lancet article in the results section is that:
""The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against NAAT-confirmed COVID-19. The primary outcome was virologically confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19, defined as a NAAT-positive swab combined with at least one qualifying symptom (fever e37·8°C, cough, shortness of breath, or anosmia or ageusia).""",askscience,250,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ld31as/are_the_vaccine_efficacies_for_covid_vaccines/

If so, does checking the antibody test at the appropriate time after the vaccine confirm that the person is protected and that they are in the right percentage of vaccine efficacy?",askscience,349,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/m1wbrb/what_does_the_coronavirus_vaccine_effectiveness/
