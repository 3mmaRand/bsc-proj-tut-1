The reason adenovirus is used is because it was discovered way back in 1953, later discovered to cause tumor (cancers) in mice. When used as a delivery vehicle though, it has been shown to be safe (although the field of gene therapy was set back a decade or so when [Jesse Gelsinger died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Gelsinger)in a U Penn clinical trial, and yes, they used an adenoviral vector).

The answer to your question 'can this platform be used' is yes it absolutely can - the technology can be 're-used' with simply new DNA 'cargo' to the new virus target.

Looking up the [47 vaccines using this tracking tool](https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2020/3/covid-19-vaccine-tracker), CanSino's (China's) leading vaccine is based on Adenovirus 5, and Oxford's / AstraZeneca's vaccine is based on a chimpanzee adenovirus.",1

I'm not sure ""absolutely can"" is appropriate, it's a very legitimate concern that people with immunity to the vector might clear the viral vector too fast for it to work efficiently and thus not respond much to the vaccine antigen. That's the reason that the companies developing these vaccines often choose low seroprevalence adenoviruses (eg. chimpanzee adenoviruses) in the first place - to avoid pre-existing immune responses to the vector. 

It isn't incredibly clear how big of an issue this is, as some studies suggest that immunity can still develop reasonably well after the second use of a vector, whereas others have suggested that pre-existing antibodies against the adenovirus being used as a vector results in lower titers of antibody against the antigen being vaccinated against.",1_2

The Ad5 vector cannot replicate, and is well-suited for both mucosal cell entry (lining of your nasal and bronchial passageways) as well as other cells in the body.

This virus then has to be produced in large billions quantity per individual, and the method to produce them industrially is known.

Also in favor of Ad5 is storage, it doesnt have -20C or even -80C storage (dry ice shipment) (like Modernas) requirements.

The virus delivers a single payload to a single cell - say a fibroblast cell below the skin - and that cell will start pumping out SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and express it on the cell surface.

Your immune system will recognize it and start generating both a general and a specific immune response - including those valuable CD4+ Th1 T-helper cells.",1_3_1

So really the target cell and ""source"" virus the payload is derived from are largely irrelevant outside of what works for the treatment at hand. AD5 acts like a normal virus and injects the payload for creating an antigen of the source virus (the spike protein in this case). The ""infected"" cell then picks up the payload as part of its normal protein synthesis, like it would a regular viral payload, but in this case it only creates the antigen instead of the entire virus. Then the immune system can respond to those antigens without threat of there being an actual virus attached to it that can reproduce.

The reason it may not be overwhelming is because the vaccines are non-replicating vectors that only express the gene for the vaccine antigen. So you input the complete virus, with its surface antigens, but only at a low level. The adenovirus enters cells, and starts producing vaccine antigen (driving an immune response, hopefully) but does not make any more of its own surface antigens. So the only driver of immunity is the low level of input virion. 

Is that enough to cause an immune response? Probably yes, but without an inflammatory driver at the same time youd tentatively predict that the immunity to the adenovirus antigens would be low and short-lived.

It's very different from disease to disease. As a general model the herd immunity threshold is at (1-1/R0). R0 is defined as the number of secondary infections that arise on average from a single primary infection (IE: how many other people will the average person pass the disease on to when they get the disease).

r0 is very disease dependent. The measles is *very* high (R0 = 12 to 18). Influenza is pretty low (R0 = 2). These numbers are further affected by environmental conditions. R0 will generally be higher in areas of high population density. They might be affected by the season or the climate of the area the disease is spreading in as well.

So herd immunity thresholds can range from like 95% (R0=18) on the high end to 50% on the low end (R0=2).

SARS-COV-2 is on the lower end. When we're all socially distanced [R0 is under 2 in most places](https://rt.live/). Meaning the virus will start to die out at about 50% of the population infected. With no distancing the number was estimated to be in the 3-4 range in most cases. Meaning the 66%-75% of the population needs to be infected to reach herd immunity.",3_1_2

COVID has been a contentious one to pinpoint, we know that a Herd immunity is reached in almost all diseases at 80+% of the population being immune. Some are claiming that COVID can be less but that seems to be wishful thinking. I am a surgeon, not an epidemiologist. 80-90% is what I remember from medical school. 

But lets say that the number is 80% to be guaranteed here immunity status. 

That means 80% of people have to be immune either by vaccine or prior infection. If 10% of the population is immune through actual infection, that leaves us with 70% of the population to get immunity from vaccination. 

If the vaccine is only 90% effective (that is only 9 people out of 10 vaccinated gets immunity from it. Then we would have to multiply the 70% x 100 and divide by 90. Which is 77.7% that would be the percentage of the population required to get the vaccine in order for 70% of the population to be immune by vaccination. 


If you lower the herd immunity target number to 70% then you only need to vaccinate 67% of the population (still assuming that 10% got natural infection) And so on.

Latest CDC data was that less than 10% of Americans have Evidence of period infection. Dr Gottlieb said recently that he expect that we correctly identify 1 in each 5 infected. With US at 10mil diagnosed infections, that means 30 mil already got the disease so far, and thus the 10% number.

The actual mass is a lot more complicated as you would have to account for immunity fading, etc. 

So a 90% effective vaccine would be great if everyone on the nation received it tomorrow, but we are a really long way from that.",3_4_1

Even though some vaccines don't offer 100% protection, the vaccine usually stimulates the immune system and still significantly LESSENS THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE to those that are infected. 

Infected, yet vaccinated,  creatures generally have a less severe course of the disease, and are significantly less likely to die from the disease. 

*The specific example that we talk about daily with owners is the ""strangles"" vaccine for horses. In an unvaccinated horse, the disease course is horrible, and often fatal, and HIGHLY contagious. Most vaccines for the disease now offer \~ 85% immunity, and if a vaccinated horse contracts the disease, the (painfully) disgusting symptoms are lessened.

The reason is that after the first, your immune system is now ""primed,"" it recognizes the viral antigen being presented (the ""spike"" protein), and wants to contain the threat as quickly as possible.

There will be some discussion, but it will be discussed more by the media than by scientists because this whole thing has been the most public display of science ever.  Scientists will very quickly say that it's safe, and there'll be some studies showing that an mRNA booster is effective following the AZ or J/J initial vaccine.  I expect that Moderna and/or Pfizer may want a study looking at needing a second mRNA booster of their vaccine if a person only had the AZ or J/J vaccine previously, but that will probably turn out to be unnecessary.

It will be interesting to see which vaccine makes it into a booster combo (I expect these to be paired with influenza for a few years at least).  The adenovirus vaccines like AZ and J/J have a slight advantage there, because they're inactivated viruses which have been included in other iterations of combo vaccines in the past.  We've obviously never used mRNA vaccines before, so we don't know how well they might work when combined with the annual flu vaccine.  I expect they will do fine, and Moderna and Pfizer are probably scrambling to adjust their formulations so that they can be added to the annual flu vaccines, and then they'll want to know if they're effective when added.  

I'm optimistic this will all work out, and that people who've received their full course of whatever vaccine will be very protected against most developing mutants and will otherwise be fine getting whatever version is included in the annual flu vaccine formulations.",5_1_1_1

Only problem with Covid is that it seems to be transmitting just fine in asymptomatic people. What I read, though, gives me more hope that the vaccine is actually going to minimize transmission in asymptotic people. Perhaps because it prevents the virus from going through some particular stage of its pathogenesis and reaching upper respiratory tissues at a level necessary for meaningful transmission *to other vaccinated people*.

Emily Oster recently wrote an article in The Atlantic discussing what she interprets to be a very low risk of complications from COVID in children, and it was my understanding that many physicians and epidemiologists agreed with this assessment (we have, after all, been told that we are isolating to protect the elderly and medically vulnerable, not low-risk populations). However, there has been an incredible backlash against her article, and many in the scientific community said that her messaging will lead to unnecessary deaths. I am not clear if they mean deaths of children (few have died so far) or of vaccinated adults (I thought we are essentially eliminating hospitalizations and deaths with the vaccine). 

If all adults have had a chance to be vaccinated, and children are as low-risk as weve been told, what are your recommendations for what children can safely do while unvaccinated (including those under the age of 12, whose vaccine trials are only now beginning and will not be approved for many months)?

The thought is that it takes increasingly virulent virus mutants to infect vaccinated individuals (who are more or less fine in this model) such that the virus can replicate and be transmitted, even at low levels. 

The problem that arises is when vaccinated individuals come in contact with unvaccinated individuals - they (the unvaccinated) are like a gasoline soaked rag when you get a spark (the vaccinated) near them.

The whole argument isn't even anti-vax (and it's a terrible thing the anti-vaxxers see it that way).

Given the 20-30 age bracket and good health, am I more protected from brain damage with a vaccine, or with continued mask use and social distancing?

1.5.) If infection occurs, are there any ways to prevent certain outcomes like brain, heart, or lung inflammation specifically compared to just reducing negative effects overall? (specific nutrient intake, medication, etc.)

2.) Is there any alternative way to seek compensation for vaccine induced side effects given the PREP act's liability immunity for vaccine manufacturer and distribution?

3.) What percentage of the population needs to have had COVID or a vaccine to reach herd immunity?

4.) How long does COVID immunity last after infection, and how long does vaccine immunity last, or has that not been found yet?

5.) Why haven't there been successful RNA vaccines before now?

6.) can all vaccines be developed in 8 months if enough funding were supplied to them, or were certain time intensive steps skipped in this case to release it faster?

My understanding is that no company is doing either. That said, they kind of don't have to. First, because the science strongly suggests you actually can't be immune to something and also a carrier.

 To delve a little deeper into that:
In very basic, very short, terms a vaccine trains your immune system to eliminate a virus using the same process your body uses to eliminate a virus the second time it ""sees"" it. This is what we refer to as immunity, the idea that on exposure to a specific pathogen your body will immediately produce antibodies and kill it dead.

In general, a carrier doesn't eliminate the pathogen at all. The process behind carriers is not hugely well understood but it seems that either the carrier's immune system ends up balanced on the knife edge between eliminating the pathogen and the person succumbing to it or, more often, the pathogen ""hides"" in an abnormal way in that person but continues to shed the virus. In the case of typhoid the suggestion is that the disease ""hides"" in one specific type of immune cell (macrophage) in carriers but doesn't affect the other cells of the carrier meaning it can still spread but does not disrupt the normal function of the carrier's body.

So, even shorter version, an immune person will kill off a disease on contact. A carrier will contract the disease but be unaffected/only mildly affected in unnoticeable ways while spreading the disease.

It's probably not possible for a vaccine (which specifically trains the immune system to eliminate the virus) to create a carrier (which probably requires a specific mutation or difference of the person).",2_1_1_2_1_1_2

This is probably mostly a practical issue, tens of thousands of people would need to get swabbed and lab tested every week or two to guarantee the process if you were looking at it that way.

It's not that important to catch possible asymptomatic spreaders.  The easy to measure goal is preventing COVID illness.  

For one, it doesn't seem likely that a person with vaccine  immunity  would get an asymptomatic infection that was still thriving enough to spread, but not enough to make the person sick.  Such an infection might be too transient to catch consistently on a nasal swab.  And if people are vaccinated to the point of herd immunity, a transient, weak spreader is not a significant problem.
