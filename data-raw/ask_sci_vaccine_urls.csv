12/06/2023,1686543618,AskSciences concerns regarding Reddits API changes,"In April 2023, [Reddit announced they would begin charging for its application programming interface (API)
access](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/technology/reddit-ai-openai-google.html).

API is used to allow different applications to interact with each other. We are a heavily moderated subreddit, and we use API access for moderation, AMA organisation, and insights into our community. We are using community-driven tools which use the API in order to make management of a community as large as /r/askscience practical for our group of volunteer moderators.

At the same time, we recognise both Reddit's mission as a corporation, as well as the dangers and risks arising from access to the API. Reddit is looking for ways to [monetize its user-generated content](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/upcoming-reddit-blackout-and-future-third-party-applications); the Times article linked above notes has been used to train high-profile machine learning models like OpenAI's.

While Reddit administration has mentioned [free access for moderation tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/), we believe their current approach of gatekeeping access based on arbitrary and indiscriminate rate limiting has several shortcomings:  
It disproportionately impacts people who use Reddit with accommodations, such as screen readers: Reddit has stated that [accessibility-focused apps will be exempt from the new restrictions](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/reddit-makes-an-exception-for-accessibility-apps-under-new-api-terms/) but has offered little clarity on what that means for this rapidly-approaching change  
It does not reflect Reddits promise to [support moderation
  tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/)  
It does not establish clear and concise criteria for what is legitimate API usage  

We also remain cognisant of Reddits past promises to [improve communication with
moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cbo4m/we_apologize/) and build tools for us to improve search and combat hateful rhetoric, anti-vaccination, and COVID denialism. While Reddit has banned hate speech and banned communities spreading science denialism, we feel they have not delivered on moderation tools and support. We feel that 3rd-party tools still offer superior support for moderation as well as accessibility features.

Everyone in the /r/askscience community contributes to its quality and longevity by volunteering their time and expertise to question, answer, and moderate scientific discussion. We feel the Reddit administration does a disservice our passion for large-scale, high-quality science communication by [pursuing a unilateral and opaque
direction](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/). This damages our community and ultimately Reddit itself by severing the trust we place upon it as a platform for science education and outreach.

Ask us anything!","Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to doctors. It spreads through the air. Particles of virus can float for up to 2 hours after an infected person passes through a room. People are contagious for 4 days before they have a rash and about 4 days after they get the rash. Because it's so easy to catch, about 95% of a population has to be vaccinated against the measles to stop it from spreading. In 2017, the latest year for which data are available, only 91.5% of toddlers in the U.S. were vaccinated, according to the CDC.  The number of cases of measles reported during 2019 is the largest number since 1992.  The effectiveness of one dose of measles vaccine is about 93% while after the two recommended doses it is 97%.

We are a vaccinologist, a pediatrician and a primary care physician. Ask us anything! Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to doctors. It spreads through the air. Particles of virus can float for up to 2 hours after an infected person passes through a room. People are contagious for 4 days before they have a rash and about 4 days after they get the rash. Because it's so easy to catch, about 95% of a population has to be vaccinated against the measles to stop it from spreading. In 2017, the latest year for which data are available, only 91.5% of toddlers in the U.S. were vaccinated, according to the CDC.  The number of cases of measles reported during 2019 is the largest number since 1992.  The effectiveness of one dose of measles vaccine is about 93% while after the two recommended doses it is 97%.

The AMA has concluded.  From Dr. Omer: 

&gt; Thanks everyone. I really enjoyed interacting with you. I know there are many questions I wasn't able to get to. However, I'd would be happy to continue the conversation in coming days over Twitter - a medium I use more frequently. My handle is @SaadOmer3.

&gt; P.S. Sorry for the typos (I'm sure there're many). I am a bad proofreader; particularly in a hurry.

We'll answer questions about the approved vaccines, what the clinical trial results mean (and don't mean), and how the approval processes have worked. We'll also discuss what other vaccine candidates are in the pipeline, and whether the first to complete the clinical trials will actually be the most effective against this disease. Finally, we'll talk about what sort of timeline we should expect to return to normalcy, and what the process will be like for distributing and vaccinating the world's population. Ask us anything!

My question: We have all heard the quoted 95% for e.g Pfizer and 70% effective for Oxford vaccines.

For example,  Pfizer only tested to confirm  (by PCR)  symptomatic patients,  whilst Oxford tested (at least in the UK cohort) weekly regardless of symptoms,  and as a result picked up a huge number of asymptomatic infections (almost half of the UK infections seen in the study) and included those in calculating its 70% figure.  Surely this means that on a comparable basis the Pfizer efficacy would be much lower? How can we compare them?

EDIT: a number of commenters have pointed out that my question was in fact based on a misunderstanding (I think based on the UK study report alone and not the pooled data article),  and that the Oxford efficacy calculation  appears to have only looked at the symptomatic cases so they are actually more comparable than I had realised.

10/03/2021,1615379034,What does the coronavirus vaccine effectiveness rate mean?,"What does it mean that (the coronavirus) vaccine is XX% effective? 

As I understand it, after the vaccine is administered, the body produces antibodies. So why is one vaccine 60% effective and another 98% effective? Does this mean that after the administration of the former vaccine, only 60% of the patients produce antibodies? 

If so, does checking the antibody test at the appropriate time after the vaccine confirm that the person is protected and that they are in the right percentage of vaccine efficacy?",askscience,349,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/m1wbrb/what_does_the_coronavirus_vaccine_effectiveness/,m1wbrb,"What does the coronavirus vaccine effectiveness rate mean?

Shouldn't it just be ""begin Phase 3a"" at whatever rate the vaccine can be produced, and include placebos, continue to add new phase 3a patients at the dose production rate. When the number of cases in the placebo group have become sufficient to determine efficacy and the efficacy is good move to phase 3b, just continue administering doses of the real vaccine and no more placebo, could we have been at about 10 million people vaccinated by now? When your confidence reaches a certain level, discontinue asymptomatic monitoring that requires one-to-one medical staff, and discontinue smart watch requirements, but encourage patients to continue log data if they wish.  Also reduce the patient acceptance requirements.  For this particular incident, the explicit dividing line between Phase 3 and rollout is costing 1000-2000 lives a day.",askscience,227,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/k955d8/why_is_there_an_explicit_line_between_phase_3_and/,k955d8,"Why is there an explicit line between Phase 3 and roll out of a vaccine?
