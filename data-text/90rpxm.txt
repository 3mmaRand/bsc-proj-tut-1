Are there other studies on the efficacy of TDAP vaccines given to mothers during pregnancy for the protection of a newborn or is this the only one? As the title states, I have found one study showing the efficacy of the TDAP vaccine given to mothers. ([http://news.unchealthcare.org/news/2018/june/unc-study-tdap-vaccine-given-during-pregnancy-reduces-occurrence-of-infant-pertussis-reinforces-cdc-recommendations-of-immunization-for-all-mothers](http://news.unchealthcare.org/news/2018/june/unc-study-tdap-vaccine-given-during-pregnancy-reduces-occurrence-of-infant-pertussis-reinforces-cdc-recommendations-of-immunization-for-all-mothers)). However, this appears pretty recent so I dont know if it has gone through peer review and/or the results have been reproduced. I am aware of the fallacy of relying upon just one study only to find out it was an erroneous result. However, Im not super proficient in doing scientific research and havent found other studies. 

My question is twofold: 1) At what stage of the scientific vetting process is this result/Has anyone reproduced it? 2). I know that before efficacy studies are done, there are usually safety studies completed. Can you help me find those so I can take a look at them (Im having trouble finding studies)?
