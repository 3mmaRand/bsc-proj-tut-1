At the end of the Covid-19 Vaccine trials, were the patients told what they got and the placebo group given first shot at getting the real Vaccine? There's so much question left as to whether the vaccine will give a long lasting immunity to Covid-19 symptoms, I started wondering how the Phase 3 trials end. Does everybody find out what they got? Do they keep reporting in for a couple years? Do the placebo groups get a front of the line pass to the real vaccine? Are there still people who got the placebo walking around thinking they might be immune?

Seems to me that early data is best data, so the original vaccine group need to be monitored. If month 5 comes and suddenly a bunch of them get sick, it means the immunity didn't last long after all :(
