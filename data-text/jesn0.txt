Are unprofitable but effective cancer drugs really being withheld from the public? I have been hearing more and more about drugs that effectively treat cancer but are not being supported by pharmaceutical companies because they can't make a profit on them.

For example, I have heard of dichloroacetate (DCA) and hydrazine sulfate (HS) but since they are apparently common or cheap, study funding is hard to come by.

Is there any truth to this or is it just media hype?

**edit**: I understand that most companies are above-board and want  to help people as well as make money.  Don't forget about [Bayer's greed](http://www.naturalnews.com/News_000647_Bayer_vaccines_HIV.html) though.
