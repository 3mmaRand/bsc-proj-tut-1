How much do we know about mRNA vaccines? How much study has there been around mRNA vaccines? How much worry should we have around them?

Just to note, I am in no way anti-vax, I just worry about the novel approach of making the human cells generate proteins via DNA manipulation. Please tell me I'm just being paranoid :) (this is coming from someone who has been on various biologics such as Remicade, Humira, and Entyvio)
