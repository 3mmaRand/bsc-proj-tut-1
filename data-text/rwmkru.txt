Are there any organisms that consume viruses? Not thinking multicellular likely a marine plankton or small single called protists

Edit: Thank you for all of the answers and links to interesting websites/ papers. Just to clear a few things up I was referring to free living virophores (if they are called that). 

Edit 2: Also thank you for all the people telling me their kids consume them. Not quite what I was looking for lol, and to the one person which attempted to make this about vaccines and presumably Covid, that was no help at all.

Edit 3: well I guess the answer was uncovered in the last few days. Nearly a year later
