Are they really using HIV to treat cancer or is that misleading? EDIT2: I'd like to apologize for the wording of the question. Reading it now, I see how badly worded it is. In a way, it's kind of both (if I've understood the explanations). Rather, it can be misunderstood (so, not necessarily purposely misleading), but HIV is being used in a way (not a ["a normal/'wild type' HIV virus"](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2vbfkl/are_they_really_using_hiv_to_treat_cancer_or_is/cog7z4d)). However, a better wording is ["they used a highly modified retrovirus to deliver genetic material to T-cells"](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2vbfkl/are_they_really_using_hiv_to_treat_cancer_or_is/cog85ev) and ["No form of virus is injected into the patient at any time"](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2vbfkl/are_they_really_using_hiv_to_treat_cancer_or_is/cogf0fp). 

See comment section for more detail.
/EDIT2

There are all types of sites that seem to say that HIV is used to cure cancer (such as [this site](http://www.medicaldaily.com/hiv-helped-utah-man-battle-cancer-how-disabled-hiv-turns-t-cells-serial-killers-310344)) and then there is [Cancer Research UK (article: *No, doctors did not inject HIV into a dying girl to treat her cancer*)](http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2013/06/25/no-doctors-did-not-inject-hiv-into-a-dying-girl-to-treat-her-cancer/) which seems reliable, but I would like the opinion of experts as maybe this is just one case, and they actually are using HIV to treat even though that might seem off to me. Is HIV being used or is that misleading?

Also from the same site, [an article about how it's not exactly measles that is being used to help cure cancer](http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2014/05/16/could-measles-cure-cancer-uh-not-exactly/) which points out how it's not really measles or the vaccine that is being used. Assuming the site is a good site to get information, this seems like a common problem with the general public. Do any professionals have to deal with this or realize how much misinformation there is out there? What ways is there to counter mainstream media misinformation (this might be a question for another forum though)?

I bring this up, because I am currently going back and forth with a user about this and want to make sure that I'm not backing incorrect information.

Thank you.

EDIT1: This post was started due to a comment by /r/stoned_shaman which I didn't submit with the post, because I thought it wouldn't really be relevant. However, in some discussions it has become relevant, so I'm posting it here:

&gt; Nope, human immunodeficiency virus actually. They're using viruses like HIV to kill cancer cells and there's good results from this! So if cancer is going to fuck you just get the oul HIV to kill it. The down side is you have HIV, but thats manageable and hey, your alive!


I should point out that I don't think /r/stoned_shaman actually believes this anymore as they were following this thread. However, I want to point out what the perception is for some people when they read of this type of treatment. I don't exactly know what I thought before this point, but I think it was close to the same (the virus in full, but disabled somehow... I didn't really think about it), but when it was spelled out the way it was put (the treated person actually gets HIV) something didn't seem right, so I looked it up. Then I posted this thread. /EDIT1
