Why don't we have vaccines against ticks? Considering how widespread, annoying, and dangerous ticks are, I'd like to know why we haven't developed vaccines against them.

An older thread here mentioned a potential prophylatic drug against Lyme, but what I have in mind are ticks in general, not just one species.

I would have thought at least the military would be interested in this sort of thing.
