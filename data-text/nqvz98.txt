What exactly is missing for the covid-19 vaccines to be full approved, and not only emergency approved? I trust the results that show that the vaccinea are safe and effective. I was talking to someone who is not an anti Vax, but didn't want to take any covid vaccine because he said it was rushed. I explained him that it did follow a thorough blind test, and did not skip any important step. And I also explained that it was possible to make this fast because it was a priority to everyone and because we had many subjects who allowed the trials to run faster, which usually doesn't happen normally.
But then he questioned me about why were the vaccines not fully approved, by the FDA for example. I don't know the reason and I could not find an answer online.

Can someone explain me what exactly is missing or was skipped to get a full approval?
