Why do dart guns require less precision than a medical syringe? Whenever I go to the doctor for blood samples or vaccines, they always insert the syringe in an arterie. But I never see hunters aiming for arteries on animals, yet the tranquilizing effect stil happens. The doctor also needs to feel my arm to find the arteries, something I imagine would be impossible for hunters.

I know the blood circulatory system is the body's way of transporting hormones and important nutrients around the body. Do tranquilizing darts:

1. Affect the nervous system? The body's other method of transporting, used for electrical signals.
2. Have so strong dose that they affect blood stream even when fired into tissue?
3. Actually hit arteries? Who knows, maybe I'm underestimating the skills of hunters?
