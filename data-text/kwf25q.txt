AskScience AMA Series: We're a team of scientists and communicators sharing the best of what we know about overcoming COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy - Ask us anything! Soon, the COVID-19 vaccine will be available to everyone. Public health professionals are asking how to build confidence and trust in the vaccine. We're here to answer some of those questions. We're not biomedical scientists, but our team of experts in psychology, behavioral science, public health, and communications can give you a look behind the scenes of building vaccine confidence, vaccine hesitancy and the communications work that goes into addressing it. Our answers today are informed by a [guide we built on COVID-19 vaccine communications](https://covid19vaccinescommunicationprinciples.org/) on behalf of Purpose and the United Nations Verified initiative, as well as years of experience in our fields.

Joining today are Ann Searight Christiano, Director of the University of Florida Center for Public Interest Communications; Jack Barry, Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Florida Center for Public Interest Communications; Lisa Fazio, Assistant Professor of Psychology at Vanderbilt University; Neil Lewis, Jr., a behavioral, intervention, and meta-scientist, as well as Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication at Cornell University and the Division of General Internal Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine; Kurt Gray, Associate Professor in Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; and Jonathan Kennedy, Senior Lecturer in Global Public Health at Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London. - Ask us anything.
