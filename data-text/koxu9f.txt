What happens in the ~10d it takes for the first dose of a mRNA vaccine to have any efficacy? I'm familiar with the mechanism of action for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. What I'm wondering is what happens after the injection and before one is said to likely have some protection from symptomatic Covid-19 (~10d, according to trial data). In other words, why does it take that many days to have some effective immune response? Doesn't the immune response to actual Covid-19 infection mount sooner?
