Any studies/statistics on effects/effectiveness of 3rd dose of covid-19 Vaccines? Lot of countries are now offering 3rd shot for some age groups (mostly mrna based vaccines). Are there any studies on possible side effects from the booster shot?  (e.g. does someone who had bad side effects after the 2nd  shot going to have similar after the 3rd one? or someone who had no bad side effects will have the same fate?). 

Also if someone didn't develop a lot of antibodies during the first course would the 3rd dosage have any effect? 

Are there any statistics on side effects and how long the 3rd shot immunity / antibodies last? Is it more than the first two or less?
