If someone becomes immunized, and you receive their blood, do you then become immunized? Say I receive the yellow fever vaccine and have enough time to develop antibodies (Ab) to the antigens there-within. Then later, my friend, who happens to be the exact same blood type, is in a car accident and receives 2 units of my donated blood. 

Would they then inherit my Ab to defend themselves against yellow fever? Or does their immune system immediately kill off my antibodies? 
(Or does donated blood have Ab filtered out somehow and I am ignorant of the process?)

If they do inherit my antibodies, is this just a temporary effect as they don't have the memory B cells to continue producing the antibodies for themselves? Or do the B cells learn and my friend is super cool and avoided the yellow fever vaccine shortage?

EDIT: Holy shnikies! Thanks for all your responses and the time you put in! I enjoyed reading all the reasoning. 

Also, thanks for the gold, friend. Next time I donate temporary passive immunity from standard diseases in a blood donation, it'll be in your name of "kind stranger".
