Why did they opt for an mRNA COVID vaccine as opposed to using said mRNA to generate the viral antigens and inject those instead? I'd figure the viral antigens themselves would be a lot more stable than mRNA and maybe not need to be stored at such extremely cold temperatures. 

Since everybody is getting the same mRNA and thus generating the exact same viral antigens, why not just produce the antigens in situ (or in vivo with COVID-infectable animals), purify the viral antigens, and ship those as the COVID vaccine?
