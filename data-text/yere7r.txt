How come we don't have an RSV vaccine? We got a (not sure I can name the disease) vaccine in less than a year. RSV has been an issue for decades and no vaccine. What is complex about RSV that we can't get a vaccine? I don't think we have an HIV vaccine and my understanding its because HIV attacks white blood cells so its very difficult to make a vaccine for it. 

What is so difficult about RSV? I have seen some news reports speculating that we "may" be close to a vaccine, but we do not have it yet.
