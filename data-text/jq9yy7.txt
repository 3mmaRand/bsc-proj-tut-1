How do we vaccinate against Salmonella, since Salmonella is a bacterium and not a virus? In the UK it is commonly advertised that some food supply chickens are "vaccinated" against Salmonella enterica. Example: [https://mmbr.asm.org/content/81/3/e00007-17](https://mmbr.asm.org/content/81/3/e00007-17)

My education has only described how viral inoculation works. Not antibacterial inoculation. Could someone explain please?

This is especially interesting to me since in the UK the agriculture industry makes quite an issue about how they don't pump the food supply full of antibiotics.

Note, a better flair would be Food Science, since it's engineering rather than pure biology.
