How does it make sense to mix and match vaccines? I thought all the vaccines were different and some of them worked in very different ways. In that case, wouldn't mix and matching vaccines be less effective than getting two of the same? Would it even be more effective than just getting one?

So, I'm seeing a few different things being said...

One, Pfizer and Moderna are basically the same,

Two, vaccines generally all have the same end goal anyway,

Three, in theory it makes sense and the reason we weren't doing it in the first place is that all the tests were done with two of the same.
