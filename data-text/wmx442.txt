If you got a Polio vaccine as a child, would you need to get re-vaccinated to be protected? Polio was one of my childhood vaccinations in the 1970s. I have the vaccination card my parents got for me as a child. Would I need to get vaccinated again to be safe? 

Can you get a polio vaccine in the US these days? Where would you get it?
