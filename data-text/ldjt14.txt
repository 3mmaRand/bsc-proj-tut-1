COVID vaccine effectiveness and different COVID variants.. why do the variants have different effectiveness? I have two questions!

1. Why do mRNA vaccines provide more or less protection based on SARS-CoV-2 variants? If they all infect with the spike protein, it should be the same, right?

2. Why do lipid based(Pfizer, Moderna) vaccines appear to be more effective against SARS-CoV-2 than adenovirus vaccines(J&amp;J, etc)?
