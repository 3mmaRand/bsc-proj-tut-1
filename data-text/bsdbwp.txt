What do heavy metals really do to a person, and what does our body do to get rid of them? Theres been plenty of misinformation spread thanks to the vaccine scare, so Im curious to have some facts. 

Lets say some unfortunate person has eaten a tomato with an amount of lead in or on it. 

The symptoms of heavy metal poisoning are easy enough to find online, but what exactly is happening to cause the symptoms? Its usually a bad thing to have them around in the body, so what does the body do to remove them? Are they just filtered out by the kidneys like a lot of other stuff? Do they break down somehow on their own?
