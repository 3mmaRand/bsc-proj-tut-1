Can babies get vaccine antibodies from mom through her breast milk? Theres a great body of research on transfer of immunity through the placenta wall, but Im having difficulty in finding good information on how well antibodies are adopted when absorbed through the gut, whether it be through colostrum or breast milk. Also, considering the change in gut behavior from a closed gut to an open gut.

Can anyone shed some light on the subject?
