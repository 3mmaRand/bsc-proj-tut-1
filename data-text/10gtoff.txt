What does the best current evidence say about the efficacy of the bivalent COVID-19 vaccines? In particular, what do evidence-based studies say about the effectiveness of the bivalent vaccines against currently-circulating variants for those who have previously had the primary series, the original booster, and who have subsequently had COVID-19. Some previous data suggested that there's a short term (few weeks) boost in antibody titers of a similar magnitude to those seen with the original wild-type booster, but that those gains quickly evaporate back to a baseline antibody level from prior to the bivalent booster. Is there data separating the short and longer term benefits in terms of both transmission protection and hospitalization/death prevention? Bonus points for studies containing data specific to children and pregnant women.
