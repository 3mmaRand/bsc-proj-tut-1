Are vaccines preventative only? Are there any diseases that can be cured by administering their respective vaccine? What's the case for COVID-19? From my little knowledge about biology I know vaccines are given before you get infected with a disease so that your body already has the respective antibodies in case you do get infected. Are there any vaccines that can be given when the person is ill already? To help maybe boost the process of making antibodies. Additionally can the COVID-19 vaccine be given to people already suffering from the virus? Will there be any ill effects?
