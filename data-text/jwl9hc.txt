Do Drug Trials get Peer-reviewed? (Related to Pfizer's COVID vaccine that's supposedly 95% effective) Hi everyone!

I currently have a discussion with my friend about whether or not having Pfizer's trials get peer-reviewed. From my understanding, the approval process for new drugs are stringent enough to make peer-review unnecessary.

So do drug trial results get peer-reviewed?
