Why do vaccines provide longer immunity from a virus than natural infection? I know that the antibodies released by the B cells in the secondary infection will be more specific to the deactivation of the virus for the vaccine compared to natural infection and other advantages like that. However, I couldn't find much when I was looking for the reason that vaccines provide longer immunity, I was only reading how in both cases there will be memory cells for secondary infection. Sources would be greatly appreciated.
