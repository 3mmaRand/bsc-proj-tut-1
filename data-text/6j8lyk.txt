I am cancer researcher Wes Wilson. I study immunotherapies, which use the immune system to treat cancer. AMA! Hi, I'm Wes Wilson (/u/LabcoatNomad), a Canadian cancer researcher currently working in Australia on treating metastatic mesothelioma using combination immunotherapy treatments. I first got started in cancer research in Toronto at Sunnybrook Hospital before moving into research on childhood brain tumours at The Hospital for Sick Children. There I worked on the epigenetics of childhood brain tumour progression in 2010. 

In 2013 the journal Science labeled cancer immunotherapy as "the breakthrough of the year" and many cancer patients were given new hope for treatment. But the work and research to identify the best treatments and combinations for the variety of types of cancer is still on going and desperately needed. No one knows why some immunotherapies work for some patients and others they fail. Our work hopes to increase the effectiveness of these new therapies by combining it with adjunct therapies to help the body self-vaccinate against the tumours!

**I will be back at 8pm ET to answer your questions. Ask me anything!**
