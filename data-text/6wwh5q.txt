Why does being infected with vaccinia virus vaccine protect you from Smallpox but doesn't protect you from other "pox" such as chicken pox? Due to my career field I was recently given the vaccinia virus because I was told it's a more "mild" form of small pox, this peaked my interest and I learned the difference between vaccinia and variola virus(small pox) but could not find an answer to my question in regards to the varicella virus (chicken pox). I probably have a misinterpretation on the correlation of the word "pox" but I'd like to know, thank you!
