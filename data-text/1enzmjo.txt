Are you less likely to contract a virus immediately after a vaccination? Hi! I was just curious. If you get a routine vaccine, for something like Meningitis or Tetanus that activates your immune system to fight a deadly virus, in the immediate aftermath would it help prevent you from contracting other diseases, like colds, the flu, or COVID since your immune system is already active?

Thanks!
