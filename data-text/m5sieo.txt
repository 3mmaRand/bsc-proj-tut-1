Are the antibodies and T Cells created by mRNA and Ad26 vaccines the same or different? Whether you get mRNA (Pfizer &amp; Moderna) or Ad26 (J&amp;J), the goal is for the vaccine to make spike proteins that lead to antibodies and T Cells. Are the antibodies and T Cells created by both types...the same? Or are they different? If they're the same, is the "failure" of a vaccine caused by the vaccine not actually making the antibodies and T Cells they're meant to, or, is it that they're made, but the ones they do make (because they're different) aren't as effective?

Edit: I believe I meant to refer to the creation of B Cells instead of the creation of T Cells. I'll leave the original post as is, as your explanations have been helpful so far. Thanks everyone!
