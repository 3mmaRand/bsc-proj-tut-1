Why can we develop a vaccine for COVID in 8 months, but still don't have a vaccine for other viruses that are decades old? Not anti vaccine or anything and I plan on getting the covid one, but just wondering how a vaccine for COVID was made so quickly, and we still don't have a vaccine for HIV, respiratory syncytial virus, Epstein-Barr, etc.
