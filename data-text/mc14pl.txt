How are vaccines tested for pregnant women in an ethical way? How do they find out it's going to be safe without first potentially putting someone in danger? I get they can probably test on animals first, but then surely there's still some small risk when it goes to humans?

Sorry if I've picked the wrong flair. It was covid that inspired the question, but I'd like to know how they went through the process for other vaccines too (if there's a difference)

Edit: If anyone's reading this now, I'd recommend having a good read through all the comments: lots of expertise to be found. There's also a couple of links to organisations that track pregnant women who have chosen to have the vaccinations, a process which, I think, should answer my question. Off the top of my head: V-SAFE in the US, and the UKOSS/UKTIS study in the UK. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.
