RNA vaccines question: Could be used to regenerate tissues? I am reading about the new covid rna vaccine, and I saw the following comparison:  


&gt;Brosh said that this does not mean the vaccine changes peoples genetic code. Rather, he said it is more like a USB device (the mRNA) that is inserted into a computer (your body). It does not impact the hard drive of the computer but runs a certain program.

Why we can not have RNA vaccines to regenerate for example burned skin, or even heal heart related problems?
