If a person inhales some amount of a virus (ex., COVID) too small to cause an infection, is there potential to develop immunity? My college has mandatory vaccine &amp; masks, but as expected, there are some students still getting sick. Constantly moving through hallways, I'm potentially (or even likely) being exposed to at least some of the virus.
Is there any chance that I'm going to develop super immunity to covid from long term, (hopefully)low level exposure?

Or, to get to the meat of the curiosity, in what circumstances would this/would this not happen with any virus? What is known about the characteristics of such a scenario?
