Why is the mRNA vaccine more expensive than the "classic" vaccines? My understanding of the process was, that not only the mRNA vaccines are faster to develop, but also easier to scale up in the production. But the prices are between ~20 and ~40 for the mRNA and the AstraZeneca around 4. Why is that so?

Is it only because the production process is new and the factories have to create new production lines for it?
