With the Covid-19 vaccines nearing 10 billion administered doses, would that make it the most administered approved drug/treatment/preventative in history? I don't know what a blanket term for administered "medications" would be called when considering preventatives *and* treatments, but I'm also curious if the vaccine also beats out those things as well? 

(So not just compared to other vaccines, but to other treatments for other diseases, including long term administrations)
