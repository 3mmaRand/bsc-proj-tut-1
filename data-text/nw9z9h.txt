What affects the lifespan of memory T and B cells? I got curious and have been trying to find the information but I just couldn't find it. I know that memory lymphocytes formed after infections. But I didn't know why some live long while some are not and what makes them like that. This [source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.moh.gov.my/index.php/database_stores/attach_download/347/147%23:~:text%3DLength%2520of%2520protection%26text%3Dthat%2520BCG%2520provides%2520protection%2520more,years%2520after%2520vaccination%2520was%252014%2525.&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiR74ux4IvxAhUDyDgGHZ0bAv4QFjABegQIBBAG&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Q6OW7c8CtTPmj3Wy0vZrT&amp;cshid=1623283072617) shows different efficacy of vaccination so I just wondering why efficiency become less as time passes by.
