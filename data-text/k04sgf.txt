Why does a vaccine have to be injected through a needle? If a virus, like Sars-Cov-2 can enter the body through orifices, why can't preventive medicine like vaccine? Wouldn't it be a whole lot nicer and easier to orchestrate if everyone could just get a nose spray "vaccine"? I'm sure if it were possible the brilliant minds of several scientists would've thought of it, so I know I'm not proposing something groundbreaking here, but I'm wondering why it is not possible.
