Could the quarantines in some countries decimate the seasonal flu or other diseases that rely on constant spreading? So for example can we expect to have far less cases of the seasonal flu next year in those countries that had an actual shutdown? Of course it wouldn't be totally eradicated and start spreading again as soon as a covid vaccine/containment is done and the social distancing is stopped.
