Does a recently administered vaccine increase your immune response overall? So if I received a vaccine (not an immunoglobulin one) does my immune system become more active for a short time and more likely to destroy any kind of pathogen?

EDIT: I mean a very short term response. I don't suggest developing antibodies. Also, I don't imply any practical application.
