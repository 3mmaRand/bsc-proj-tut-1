How is it that COVID-19 "booster" vaccines help Delta more, if it's a matter of the spike proteins 'looking' different than the previous variants that the vaccine was initially designed for? I'm a little confused.

My understanding of the variants, is that they 'look' different to the antibodies that are produced from the vaccines, so consequently the vaccines aren't as effective.

So this makes me wonder why does giving a third shot of the vaccine help variants, like Delta, when the vaccines were intended for previous variants, not "different looking" variants like Delta. Wouldn't a different vaccine need to be developed for "different looking" variants? How does just injecting another of the same exact vaccine help variants that have different spike proteins etc.?
