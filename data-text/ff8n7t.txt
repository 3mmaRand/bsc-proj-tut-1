Why does it take a year or more to develop vaccines? I've read that vaccines work by introducing a mild version of the virus to the body so that it can develop an immune response. Also have heard that the entire genome sequence of COVID-19 and other viruses are uploaded online. So what's the rate determining step here?
Also related, of what use is making public the genome sequence of these viruses? And why can't it be used in biological warfare?
