After the COVID vaccine is out will we still need to social distance and wear masks? Oxford said that by the end of 2020 there will be millions of doses of the vaccine available to the public. With all of those doses out and millions more coming in the following months, when will all of the restrictions be lifted and we can return to normal life?

Edit: Wow, I was not expecting this to blow up like it did. Thank you mysterious redditor for the gold!
