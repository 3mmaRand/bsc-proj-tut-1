How will the flu vaccine composition for 2021/22 be determined with fewer flu cases this season? The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-selection.htm) says:

&gt;Flu viruses are constantly changing, so the vaccine composition is reviewed each year and updated as needed based on which influenza  viruses are making people sick, the extent to which those viruses are spreading, and how well the previous seasons vaccine protects against  those viruses. More than 100 national influenza centers in over 100 countries  conduct year-round surveillance for influenza. This involves receiving and testing thousands of influenza virus samples from patients

How will scientists decide on the strain that next season's vaccine will protect against now that flu cases are generally down?

Thanks!
