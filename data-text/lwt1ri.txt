Could we eliminate the Flu if we all got vaccinated for the flu and wore masks during flu season? Masks have been pretty effective at keeping my family healthy this year and I was wondering if some viruses like the flu are so endemic that there will always be substantial spread, or if mask use would be effective at isolating or eliminating the flu?
