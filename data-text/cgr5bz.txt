AskScience AMA Series: We are vaccination experts Dr. H Cody Meissner and Dr. Sean Palfrey, here to answer anything about vaccines with the help of the Endless Thread podcast team! AUA! As two doctors with decades of experience working to fight infectious disease, we want to help people understand the benefits of vaccines and getting vaccinated. We're taking a brief pause from our work to answer your questions, and if you've got questions for the Endless Thread podcast team and their series on vaccines and anti-vaxxers, ["Infectious,"](https://www.wbur.org/tag/infectious) they're here with us! You can find our bios and information about the live event we're doing in Boston this Thursday, find it [here](https://www.wbur.org/events/488445/endless-thread-presents-infectious-live).

We'll be starting at 1pm ET (17 UT), AUA!

EDIT: Hi everyone -- Amory here from the Endless Thread podcast team. The doctors are signing off, but for anyone in the Boston area, they'll be taking more questions live onstage at WBUR's CitySpace this Thursday, July 25th, at 7pm. Details HERE and hope to see you there!
