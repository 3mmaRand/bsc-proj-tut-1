If unvaccinated people are causing outbreaks, doesn't that mean everyone getting sick is unvaccinated? This got me thinking:

How can one unvaccinated person create such a problem for everyone else?  I'm 100% for vaccination, but I guess I don't understand how not vaccinating yourself puts others in danger, can anyone explain?

Is it because while patient zero is infected, the virus mutates into one that vaccinations don't cover?  Or are vaccinations only effective for a certain percentage of the population?
