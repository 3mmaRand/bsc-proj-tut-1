What happens if a person who was previously vaccinated against rabies gets bitten by a rabid animal (and doesnt go get booster shots or anything, they just rely on their previous vaccination)? edit: follow up question, is there some sort of mild rabies where you have just enough rabies antibodies to not die, but not enough the resist rabies fully? or is it death or no death and no in betweens
