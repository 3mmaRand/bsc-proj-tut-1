With two vaccines now approved and in use, does making a vaccine for new strains of coronavirus become easier to make? I have read reports that there is concern about the South African coronavirus strain. There seems to be more anxiety over it, due to certain mutations in the protein. If the vaccine is ineffective against this strain, or other strains in the future, what would the process be to tackle it?
