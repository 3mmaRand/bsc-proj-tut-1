COVID SILVER LINING - Will the recent success of Covid mRNA vaccines translate to success for other viruses/diseases?!? e.g. HIV, HSV, Malaria, etc. I know all of the attention is on COVID right now (deservedly so), but can we expect success with similar mRNA vaccine technology for other viruses/diseases? e.g. HIV, HSV, Malaria, Etc

Could be a major breakthrough for humanity and treating viral diseases.
