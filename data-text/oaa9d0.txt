Is vaccination always recommended after infection regardless of the type of pathogen? Is it my understanding that vaccination for COVID-19 is recommended even if you have previously tested positive for the virus.  Is this also the case for other types of pathogens with (relatively) new vaccines such as chickenpox? Why or why not?
