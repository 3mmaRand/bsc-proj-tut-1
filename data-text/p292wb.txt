What happen when an infected cell replicate itself ? Hi, 

So what i'd like to know is this, if a cell is infected by a virus or ""infected"" with mRNA from vaccine for example. What would happen if the cell replicate ? Would the new cells contain the virus or mRNA ? 

I'm thinking about this cause when you do workout you accelerate the replication process (I suppose since cells have to repair the part that you broke in your muscle during the workout). And since the vaccine is injected in the muscle I was questioning myself about that. 

Like, if it was the case, could it cause chain reaction, cells replicating with the virus again and again ? Maybe it's totally stupid tbh.
