How much of the smallpox fatality rate was due to poor healthcare, nutrition and limited disease knowledge vs. actual deadliness of the virus? Smallpox killed about 30% of those it infected and the numbers were even higher among populations with no exposure. If small pox returned, most of the population would have no exposure or vaccination history. But with more knowledge of viruses and better healthcare today, do we have a sense of how deadly it would actually be?
