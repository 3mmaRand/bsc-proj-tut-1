Experts say 70% of a population needs immunity to reach the herd threshold. Where I live, in Texas, polls say 1/3 of people refuse to get the vaccination. Can we reach herd immunity? Considering that children are not currently being vaccinated, and studies are showing that immunity is stronger and lasts longer through the vaccine as opposed to infection, how likely is it that we'll actually reach the point people are calling "back to normal"?
