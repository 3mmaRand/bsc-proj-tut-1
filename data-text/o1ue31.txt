How does the immune response that causes hay fever differ from the immune response that is utilised by COVID vaccines? (And why don't antihistamines affect the latter?) I always have a rough time aroung grass pollen season, and recently got the Moderna vaccine. I've been assured that taking my usual antihistamies won't have any effect on the vaccine working, and I believe that, but I'd love to know why.

Since allergies are an immune response, and antihistamines suppress them, what is different about other kinds of immune response that means antihistamines don't disrupt them?
