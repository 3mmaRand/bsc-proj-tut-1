Is COVID unique in the way it affects different individuals in such different ways? I've gotten COVID before getting vaccinated and it was not even my worst cold of the year but others die from it. Other diseases like the flu, salmonella, rabies, strep throat etc seem to have pretty similar effects regardless of who gets it. Is this trait unique to this disease?
