Why despite the lengthy period since the discovery of tuberculosis, is there only one vaccine (BCG) that is deemed ineffective? So many vaccines could be developed for covid in such a short span of time. So what is with TB?
Is vaccination not important part of TB elimination?
Are there any difficulties in making  effective TB vaccine?
