Do other vaccines that are widely used also have the side effect of sometimes creating blood clots? I tried googling this but I could only find stuff about covid vaccines (no surprise I guess). So that got me wondering what other vaccines that are widely used (like stuff against the flu or polio etc) also have a 1 in a million chance of creating blood clots?
