Why can't humans contract certain viruses from eating infected animals? I am getting ready to move to Asia later this year for a few years of traveling, and I'm reading up on the recommended vaccines. One of the recommended vaccines is the Japanese Enciphilitis vaccine.

When reading about JEV, I read that pigs and some birds are common breeding grounds for the virus, then mosquitos will contract the virus from the diseased animal. However, humans can only contract the virus if they get bit by a diseased mosquito, and not if they eat the diseased animal. 
 
Virology/science has never been my strong point (I'm a financial advisor, so my strength is in finance/economics), so I don't understand how you don't get sick if you eat the diseased animal. Do our stomachs have some acids that breakdown certain viruses or something? Do viruses require special types of hosts to develop to the point it can affect humans?
