Influenza vaccines are updated every year. How often are other vaccines updated? The influenza vaccine is different from year to year, to match the predicted circulating strains. Is that unique to influenza or are any other vaccines updated in a similar way? For example if I get a tetanus booster this year, is the toxoid different than the one in the booster shot I had ten years ago?

If vaccines do get updated, how often does it happen? If not, how high is the risk that a pathogen will mutate to evade the acquired immunity?
