AskScience AMA Series: I'm Jason Schwartz, an expert on vaccine policy and COVID vaccination rollout, and a professor at the Yale School of Public Health. AMA! I'm a professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health. I focus on vaccines and vaccination programs, and since last summer, I've been working exclusively on supporting efforts to accelerate the development, authorization, and distribution of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. I serve on [Connecticut's COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Group](https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Communications/Disease-Preparedness/COVID-19-Vaccine-Advisory-Group), I [testified before Congress](https://www.c-span.org/video/?473850-1/house-hearing-ensuring-safe-covid-19-vaccine) on the FDA regulation of these vaccines, and I've published my research and perspectives on COVID vaccination policy in the [New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2026393) and elsewhere.

Last fall, my colleagues and I - including Dr. Rochelle Walensky, now the director of the CDC - published a [modeling study](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.02054?utm_medium=press&amp;utm_source=mediaadvisory&amp;utm_campaign=Covidfasttrack&amp;utm_content=Schwartz) that demonstrated the importance of rapid, wide-reaching vaccine implementation and rollout activities to the success of vaccination programs and the eventual end of the pandemic, even more so than the precise efficacy of a particular vaccine. We also [wrote an op-ed](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/11/19/covid-19-vaccine-distribution-not-just-development-necessary-column/6333001002/) summarizing our findings and key messages.

Ask me about how the vaccines have been tested and evaluated, what we know about them and what we're still learning, how guidelines for vaccine prioritization have been developed and implemented, how the U.S. federal government and state governments are working to administer vaccines quickly and equitably, and anything else about COVID vaccines and vaccination programs.
