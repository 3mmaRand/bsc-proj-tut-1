Why do young, healthy people have more intense vaccine reactogenicity but get less sick when they catch a virus? I've read that young, healthy people are more likely to experience side effects from the COVID vaccines because of a robust immune response. So why do young, healthy people experience fewer symptoms/less intense illness when exposed to an actual virus?
