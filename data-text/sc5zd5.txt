If someone is infected with SARS-COV-2 before vs. after vs. no mRNA vaccination, would their non-spike (nucleocapsid/membrane/envelope) antibody reponses be similar, or different? Would they have similar levels of said antibodies? Would those persist for a similar length of time? In other words, if one person was infected *before* getting vaccinated, another was infected *after* getting vaccinated, and another was infected and *never* got vaccinated, would they have similar levels of non-spike antibodies, say, 6-12 months later? Or would the levels be higher/lower in one or the other? 

I know it varies from person to person based on many different factors, so for the sake of argument, let's say these three people are biologically identical clones and they were all asymptomatic.
