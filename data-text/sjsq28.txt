Could one make a vaccine to train one's immune system to attack their own body? As opposed to markers of some virus or whatever. Have there been incidents of people getting an autoimmune disease from vaccination trials? 

(obligatory: this is unrelated to covid, though perhaps the soreness from the booster is encouraging this on my mind.  Very pro-vaccine, I am just curious if such a thing is possible)
