AskScience AMA Series: Summer is tick season. We are experts on the science of Lyme disease (and other tickborne illnesses), and we are here to answer your questions. AUA! Lyme disease, an infection caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi that is primarily transmitted by Ixodes scapularis (also known as blacklegged or deer ticks), [affects between 30,000 and 500,000 Americans every year](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Flyme%2Fstats%2Findex.html). Beyond the characteristic erythema migrans ("bullseye") rash, symptoms range from arthritis to damaging nervous and cardiac systems. With so many cases every year, it is imperative that everyone learn what steps can be taken to minimize and prevent Lyme disease infections while also getting up to date on the current scientific and medical interventions being used to treat and cure Lyme disease in infected individuals.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (18 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, about all aspects of Lyme disease (and other tickborne diseases). We'll take your questions and discuss what people can do to prevent Lyme disease, how Lyme disease is best diagnosed and treated, and what to do if you suspect that you have Lyme disease. Ask us anything!
