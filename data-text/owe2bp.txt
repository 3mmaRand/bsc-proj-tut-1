Why are adverse reactions to vaccines more common in younger people than older people? I was looking through the adverse reactions to the COVID vaccines, and I found it interesting that the CDC report that younger people are more likely to experience (or at the very least report) an adverse reaction to the COVID vaccines than if you were older. I would have thought it would be the opposite (due to older people having weaker immune systems)? Can someone explain this phenomenon? Is this something of all vaccines? What's the biological mechanism here?

Refer to table 1 of [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7008e3.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7008e3.htm): 64.9% of 18 to 49 report an adverse reaction. I thought perhaps it was to do with unequal category sizes (18 to 49, versus say 50 to 64), but I don't think it is as this represents 2/3 of the total.

P.S. I really don't want to get into a debate about whether or not people should take the vaccine or not (I think people at risk, definitely should). I simply want to understand why vaccines effect different age groups in different ways.

(For some reason moderators removed this post... This is a legitimate medicinal question, but for some reason I'm not even allowed to ask it)
