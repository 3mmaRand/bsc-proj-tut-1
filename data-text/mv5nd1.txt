Do the Covid vaccines have positive non-specific effects? Some vaccines appear to have non-specific (or heterologous) effects. Specifically, the two live-attenuated BCG and measles vaccines seem to grant protection against things beyond what they were designed for. 

Meanwhile, the DTP vaccine, which is not live-attenuated, may have a detrimental non-specific effect, although the evidence here looks weaker. (EDIT: The possible effect here is a mild and negative immunomodulation. Studies attempting to replicate it keep giving conflicting data. Whatever it is, the effect is weak if its there at all. No reason to start questioning vaccines, people.)

I know its early but I was wondering which category the Covid vaccines might fit in. 

So, do the mRNA Covid vaccines have positive non-specific effects? Do the adenovirus-based ones?
