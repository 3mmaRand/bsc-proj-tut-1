Measles is thought to 'reset' the immune system's memory. Do victims need to re-get childhood vaccinations, e.g. chickenpox? And if we could control it, is there some good purpose to which medical science could put this 'ability' of the measles virus?

Don't bone marrow patients go through chemo to suppress or wipe our their immune system to reduce the chance of rejection of the donor marrow? Seems like a virus that does the same thing, if it could be less . .. virulent, might be a way around that horrible process. Just throwing out ideas.
