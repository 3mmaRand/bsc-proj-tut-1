How is the monkeypox vaccine effective AFTER getting exposed? The vaccine requires two doses at least 4 weeks apart. 

But it was first being given mainly after reported exposure. Symptoms can appear 5 days after exposure. 

How can the vaccine be helpful after exposure if it takes so much longer to be effective while the virus progresses so much faster?
