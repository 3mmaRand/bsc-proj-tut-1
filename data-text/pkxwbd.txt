Is the flu we get vaccinated for today just a variant of the 1918 Influenza? I know the there is basically a different strain of the flu virus every year, which is why there is a new flu shot every year. Is this the result of the 1918 Spanish Influenza pandemic? 

I've been reading that Covid is more or less here to stay, and it will likely have annual variants that may require yearly boosters. Is this similar to the 1918 pandemic?

Edit: Not sure why the post is locked, but thank you everyone for your answers.
