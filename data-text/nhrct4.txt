If you already have antibodies to a disease, would catching that disease afterward boost the antibodies allowing them to last longer than their expiration date? Say that I get a vaccine thats good for a year and sometime during that year my body catches and successfully fights off that disease. 

Would the antibodies be able to last for another year as of me successfully fighting that disease or would the one year limit still apply based on the initial gaining of antibodies?
