Are vaccine platforms reusable? I'm reading about vaccines and came across a vaccine that is based on the Adenovirus 26. To the best of my knowledge this means that after vaccination the immune system learns to defeat this adonovirus and because of the modification also learns to render the spikes on the corona virus useless. Of course I'm using layman terms here.

If someone is vaccinated with this vaccine and a different virus comes along, can this platform still be used for this new virus?
