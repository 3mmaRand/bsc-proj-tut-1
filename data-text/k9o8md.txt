Will the Covid vaccine go to people that have caught Covid already? Since the vaccine just gives your body a little piece (mRNA) of the virus would catching the actual virus do the same thing for your body? Making people that have caught Covid and survived immune to the virus since their body has already dealt with the virus and knows what to look for.

I remember around June - July that nobody was sure if you became immune once you caught Covid. but with this vaccine and how it works, it would make sense that you would be immune after catching covid. So with that, has anyone heard of "Covid survivors" getting the vaccine? Or am I wrong in thinking you'd be immune after catching Covid?
