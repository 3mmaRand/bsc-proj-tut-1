How come covid vaccines that are variant specific need to go under all 3 phases of a vaccine development again instead of being like the flu shot where they just update it and slap it on? Moderna is now in phase 2 of their omicron booster shot.

No word on Pfizer. But why the wait? Why not just submit for an EUA right away? Is the vaccine that different that it would need much data to support it? Will this be the process for every variant of concern that comes out? Cause if so, it's gonna be unsustainable.
