AskScience AMA Series: I am Jonathan Berman, author of the forthcoming "Antivaxxers: How To Challenge A Misinformed Movement" from MIT press, former co-chair of the March for Science, and a renal physiologist, AMA! My name is Jonathan Berman and my book [Antivaxxers: How to Challenge a Misinformed Movement](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/anti-vaxxers) is due out on September 8th. It is about the anti-vaccine movement and its historical antecedents, as well as what makes anti-vaxxers tick.

I hosted the unveiling of the world's largest periodic table of the elements. I've worked as a rickshaw driver, wing cook, and assistant professor. At various points I've been a stand up comic, carpet remover, and radio host, but mostly a scientist.
