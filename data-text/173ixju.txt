Why have we only approved mRNA vaccines and not DNA Plasmid Vaccines? I just read online about DNA plasmid vaccines. [https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/10.2217/fvl-2021-0170](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/10.2217/fvl-2021-0170)

Are mRNA vaccines simply superior (safer and more effective?)? Why have we not seen DNA plasmid vaccines for things like COVID-19?
