Nowadays, dogs get vaccinated for several different fatal diseases. In the past, did lots of dogs just die of them? In the US at least, dogs get shots for rabies, distemper, and parvo, and pills for heartworm.  In the past, say 1900, did dogs just catch these diseases and die from them all the time?  Rabies is an exception I guess, since once symptoms were noticed, the animals were killed ASAP.  But what about the others?
