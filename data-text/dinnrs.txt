AskScience AMA Series: Experts are warning that measles are becoming a global public health crises. We are a vaccinologist, a pediatrician and a primary care physician. Ask us anything! Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to doctors. It spreads through the air. Particles of virus can float for up to 2 hours after an infected person passes through a room. People are contagious for 4 days before they have a rash and about 4 days after they get the rash. Because it's so easy to catch, about 95% of a population has to be vaccinated against the measles to stop it from spreading. In 2017, the latest year for which data are available, only 91.5% of toddlers in the U.S. were vaccinated, according to the CDC.  The number of cases of measles reported during 2019 is the largest number since 1992.  The effectiveness of one dose of measles vaccine is about 93% while after the two recommended doses it is 97%.
