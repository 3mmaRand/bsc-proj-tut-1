What happens when a person contracts COVID between doses of the vaccine? This was removed by the mods for being hypothetical but I imagine this has happened during trials or we wouldnt have the statistics we have. So Im reposting it with less hypothetical language. 

Its my understanding that the first dose (of the Pfizer vaccine) is 52% effective at preventing COVID and the second is 95% effective. So what happens if you are exposed to COVID and contract it in the 21/28 days between doses? In the trials, did those participants get the second dose? Did they get it while infectious or after recovering? Or were they removed from the study? 

Asking because I just received the Moderna vaccine a few days ago and I want to know what would happen if I were to get it from one of my patients during the limbo period between doses. Thanks!
