Why did the WHO recommend flu vaccine manufacturers to return to making trivalent vaccines instead of adding another influenza A strain to existing quadrivalent vaccines? In light of the seeming extinction of the Influenza B/Yamagata lineage, the WHO recommended in September that the inclusion of a B/Yamagata antigen as a component of influenza vaccines is no longer warranted, and every effort should be made to exclude it as soon as possible."

The response to this has been that the flu vaccine market is shifting back to the trivalent vaccine used up until QIVs were introduced. The WHO has also acknowledged that additional support will be needed for manufacturers who currently only make quadrivalent vaccines to pivot to making trivalent vaccines.

However, my question is -- if we're already prepared to produce quadrivalent vaccines, why don't we take the "slot" opened by B/Yamagata to immunize for a third variety of Influenza A? For example, the Northern &amp; Southern hemisphere currently have different recommendations for the H3N2 vaccine component. Wouldn't it make more sense to have both H3N2 varieties packaged together and utilize the existing technology for a quadrivalent vaccine?
