If mRNA vaccines remain proven safe, is it actually necessary to go through new trials each time when vaccinating for a new strain or another disease? Obviously it's best to be careful about these things. That said, with this new form of vaccination, a lot of the uncertainty of 'old school' vaccines is out of the picture, right? Supposing the method of getting mRNA into the body remains the same, and the proteins produced are innocuous  is there still reason to think that there could be unforeseen side effects?
