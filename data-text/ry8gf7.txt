Is there real-world data showing boosters make a difference (in severity or infection) against Omicron? There were a lot of models early on that suggested that boosters stopped infection, or at least were effective at reducing the severity.

Are there any states or countries that show real-world hospitalization metrics by vaccination status, throughout the current Omicron wave?
