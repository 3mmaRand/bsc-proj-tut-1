Ask us anything! Hello r/askscience! We are infectious disease experts from the University of Chicago Medicine. Emily Landon, MD, specializes in infectious diseases and leads the academic health system's infection control and prevention efforts. As the medical specialist for the High-Consequence Pathogen Preparedness Program, Dr. Landon has helped steer UChicago Medicine, the University of Chicago, and its affiliates through the COVID-19 pandemic. She also regularly advises businesses, industries and government officials on how to best respond to the global crisis.

As multiple COVID-19 vaccines are rolling out around the world, infectious disease experts and government health agencies are beginning to issue new guidance on all aspects of life, from social distancing to mask wearing. But in this nebulous state where some are vaccinated and some are not, what does that mean for day-to-day life? What can (or should) you be doing differently, or the same, once you've been vaccinated? What can you expect after getting the vaccine? We'll be on at 4:30 PM ET (20:30 UT), ask us anything!
