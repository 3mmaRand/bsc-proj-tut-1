Why do some vaccines give lifelong immunity and others only for a set period of time? Take the BCG vaccine, as far as I'm concerned they inject you with M. bovis and it gives you something like 80% protection for life. That is my understanding at least. Or say Hepatitis B, 3 doses and then you're done.

But tetanus? Needs a boost every 5-10 years... why? Influenza I can dig because it mutates, but I don't get tetanus. Is it to do with the type of vaccine? Is it the immune response/antibodies that somehow have an expiry date? And some don't? Why are some antibodies short-lived like milk, and others are infinite like Twinkies?
