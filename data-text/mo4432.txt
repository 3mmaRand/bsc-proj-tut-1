The US Military has started human trials of a Spike Ferritin Nanoparticle COVID vaccine. How is this different from other types of vaccines? [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04784767](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04784767)

I'm having difficulty researching the tech used in this vaccine.

Is this different from the mRNA vaccines? Does this type of vaccine have a research history similar to mRNA vaccines? Is it a brand new tech or over 20 years of research like the mRNA viruses have?

Walter Reed Hospital believes this will have a wide application against many variants and different types of spikes used by coronaviruses. How wide are we talking? If I could never get another cold for the rest of my life, that would be great.

I read this community frequently. Thanks for all that you guys do!
