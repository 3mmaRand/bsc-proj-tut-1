How long would it take after a vaccine for COVID-19 is approved for use would it take to make 250 Million doses and give it to Americans? Edit: For the constant hate comments that appear about me make this about America. It wasn't out of selfishness. It just happens to be where I live and it doesn't take much of a scientist to understand its not going to go smoothly here with all the anti-vax nuts and misinformation.


Edit 2: I said 250 million to factor out people that already have had the virus and the anti-vax people who are going to refuse and die. It was still a pretty rough guess but I am well aware there are 350 million Americans.
