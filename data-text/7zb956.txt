What is the effect, positive or negative, of receiving multiple immunizations at the same time; such as when the military goes through "shot lines" to receive all deployment related vaccines? Specifically the efficacy of the immune response to each individual vaccine; if the response your body produces is more or less significant when compared to the same vaccines being given all together or spread out over a longer period of time.
Edit: clarification
