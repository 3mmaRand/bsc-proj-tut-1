How is the effectiveness of the vaccines ''waning''? Does your body just forget how to fight COVID? Does Delta kill all the cells that know how to deal with it? It's been bothering me and I just don't understand how it's rendering the vaccines ineffective and yet it reduces the symptoms of it still.
