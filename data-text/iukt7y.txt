Why are only 151 cases of Covid-19 sufficient to demonstrate that Moderna's vaccine is 60% effective in a trial with 30,000 participants? I read [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/health/covid-moderna-vaccine.html) in the New York Times today. It mentions the different points at which they will analyze the data, but I don't understand how this conclusion can be reached from such a low number.
