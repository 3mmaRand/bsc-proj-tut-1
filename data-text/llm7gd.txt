Why cannot countries mass produce their own vaccines by copying the formulae of the already approved Moderna and Pfizer vaccines? Im a Canadian and we are dependent on the EU to ship out the remaining vials of the vaccine as contractually obligated to do so however Im wondering whats stopping us from creating the vaccines on our home soil when we already have the moderna and Pfizer vaccines that we are currently slowly vaccinating the people with.

Wouldnt it be beneficial for all countries around the world to do the same to expedite the vaccination process? 

Is there a patent that prevents anyone from copying moderna/Pfizer vaccines?
