Psychologically speaking, how can a person continue to hold beliefs that are provably wrong? (E.g. vaccines causing autism, the Earth only being 6000 years old, etc) Is there some sort of psychological phenomenon which allows people to deny reality? What goes on in these people's heads? There must be some underlying mechanism or trait behind it, because it keeps popping up over and over again with different issues and populations.

Also, is there some way of derailing this process and getting a person to think rationally? Logical discussion doesn't seem to have much effect.

EDIT: Aaaaaand this blew up. Huzzah for stimulating discussion! Thanks for all the great answers, everybody!
