A credible SARS-NCOV vaccine manufacturer said large scale trials shows 90% efficiency. Is the vaccine ready(!)? Apparently the requirements by EU authorities are less strict thanks to the outbreak. Is this (or any) vaccine considered "ready"?

Are there more tests to be done? Any research left, like how to effectively mass produce it? Or is the vaccine basically ready to produce?
