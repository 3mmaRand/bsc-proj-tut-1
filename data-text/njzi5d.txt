Why are studies on how effective antibodies attained from having covid 19 are at future immunity so much more inconclusive than studies on effectiveness of the vaccine? It seems that there is consensus that having Covid gives an individual some sort of immunity going forward, but when looking up how effective that immunity is, every resource tends to state that the level of immunity is unknown and everyone should just get vaccinated. How is it that weve had much more time to study the effectiveness of antibodies attained from having covid than the time weve had to study the vaccine, but the studies on the effectiveness of the vaccine are presented to be much more conclusive?
