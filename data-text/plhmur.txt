Why shouldnt you get the COVID-19 vaccine if you have a cold/flu? Ive had a bit of a google and the closest answer I can get is that given some people experience mild to severe cold/flu like symptoms after receiving their shot - especially the 2nd shot - is that if you get the vaccine and are already unwell, that you are more likely to feel even worse than if you werent unwell? Is that correct? And if so, is it the vaccine making your cold/flu symptoms worse or is your cold/flu making the vaccine side effects worse?

Thank you, fine people of r/askscience!

EDIT: Wow guys! What a surprise to wake up too! Thank you to everyone who has commented, Im sorry I cant get them all but I really appreciate the comments and the conversations that have come from them.

I got Pfizer dose #2 yesterday and I have woken up this morning feeling wrecked. Body and joints ache, my arm hurts so bad, skin hurts and standing too long makes me feel like passing out&you know when you get all hot and your body feels&like static? And of course a headache. But Id rather this than Covid! 

So again, thank you all for commenting, and I hope wherever you are in the world that you are safe (as can be) and I hope you and your loved ones all stay healthy &lt;3
