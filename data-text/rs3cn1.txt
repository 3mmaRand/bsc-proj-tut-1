Do we have evidence that Omicron is "more mild" than Delta coronavirus? I've seen this before in other topics, where an expert makes a statement with qualifications (for example, "this variant right now seems more 'mild', but we can't say for sure until we have more data"). Soon, a black and white variation of the comment becomes media narrative. 

Do we really know that Omicron symptoms are more "mild"? (I'm leaving the term "mild" open to interpretation, because I don't even know what the media really means when they use the word.) And perhaps the observation took into account vaccination numbers that weren't there when Delta first propagated. If you look at two unvaccinated twins, one positively infected with Delta, one positively infected with Omicron, can we be reasonably assured that Omicron patient will do better?
