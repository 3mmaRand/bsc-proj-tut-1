What does the coronavirus vaccine effectiveness rate mean? What does it mean that (the coronavirus) vaccine is XX% effective? 

As I understand it, after the vaccine is administered, the body produces antibodies. So why is one vaccine 60% effective and another 98% effective? Does this mean that after the administration of the former vaccine, only 60% of the patients produce antibodies? 

If so, does checking the antibody test at the appropriate time after the vaccine confirm that the person is protected and that they are in the right percentage of vaccine efficacy?
