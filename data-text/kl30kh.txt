Why don't we make vaccines for plants? I was watching a video recently, and it talked about how a certain cultivar of bananas, gros micheal, was basically wiped off the face of the earth. And how the current popular cultivar, cavendish, is now being hit by the same disease.

The fact that we invaded honduras 7 times for bananas and coined the term banana republic for love of the fruit, yet we don't have a solution for this banana plague that is obliterating them from the face of the earth boggles my mind. I assume there is a good reason for this? A reason we can't give a tree a shot or inoculate a grain against blight?
