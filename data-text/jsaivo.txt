What is the efficacy of normal vaccines? With the announcement of the potentially "90% effective" Covid vaccine, I was wondering what the efficacy was of other vaccines.

What is the normal percentage to allow a vaccine to become licensed? How about the MMR for example?

Also, though this will likely get answered, have they reduced the required standard to try and help with the pandemic?

Thank you!
