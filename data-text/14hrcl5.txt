If mRNA vaccines train your body to fight diseases, can it train your body to not fight certain things? So with the fun news about mRNA being developed for cancer and heart disease, it made me think about where the limit is with these types of vaccines. For example, I have a very sever allergy to tree nuts and morphine, if I ingest either I need to be at the emergency room in 15-20mins before things get really bad. And it's my understanding that allergies are when you body mistakes something as an intruder in your system and works to purge it. So with these mRNA vaccines, could there be a similar method to train your body to not see, in my example, tree nuts as a danger?
