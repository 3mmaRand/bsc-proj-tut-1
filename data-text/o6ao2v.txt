How effective is the JJ vaxx against hospitalization from the Delta variant? I cannot find any reputable texts stating statistics about specifically the chances of  Hospitalization &amp; Death if you're inoculated with the JJ vaccine and you catch the Delta variant of Cov19.

If anyone could jump in, that'll be great. Thank you.
