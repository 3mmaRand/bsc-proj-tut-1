Is it possible to create a contagious Vaccine? I know a lot of half of the information. When learning about the multiple vaccines being developed, I believe one was having portions of the virus (but not the whole code) implanted in another virus to stimulate an immune response. 

Along with that I believe I heard that weapons manufactures want to splice different diseases with whooping cough to create airborne version of the diseases. 

Is there a safe way to do this with Vaccines? And if its something that could possibly happen down the line do you think the anti vaxxers would start wearing mask then?
