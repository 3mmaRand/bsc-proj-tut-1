Why does it take 2 weeks for the Covid vaccine to take effect? Would immune-suppressing drugs affect vaccine effectiveness if taken during these two weeks? Immune suppressing drugs such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, alcohol, cannabis etc. (Not seriouser stuff like chemo and steroids)

ETA: Im wondering specifically about the MRNA vaccines. And Im referring to common anti-inflammatories like the ones listed, not the immunosuppressive drugs used in cancer treatments or organ transplants.

ETA2: I dont know why comments keep getting deleted. Im not the one deleting them???
