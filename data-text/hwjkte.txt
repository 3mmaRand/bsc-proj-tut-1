Why dont we have vaccines for all Herpes Viruses? Ok so I hope I dont sound like a complete idiot, keep in mind I have very little medical knowledge. So we have vaccines for shingles and chicken pox, which are herpes viruses. However we dont have a vaccine for Cold sores, Genital Herpes, or Mononucleosis (also a herpes virus). Why is this? I know they are obviously different mutations but they all stem from the same viral tree. Is this something that the medical community is working on or is it a lost cause to find an umbrella Herpes vaccine?
