Is there research yet on likelihood of reinfection after recovering from the omicron variant? I was curious about either in vaccinated individuals or for young children (five or younger), but any cohort would be of interest. Some recommendations say "safe for 90 days" but it's unclear if this holds for this variant.

Edit: We are vaccinated, with booster, and have a child under five. Not sure why people keep assuming we're not vaccinated.
