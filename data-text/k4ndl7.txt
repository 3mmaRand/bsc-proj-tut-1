How do we know that Covid-19 vaccines won't teach our immune system to attack our own ACE2 enzymes? Is there a risk here for developing an autoimmune disorder where we teach our bodies to target molecules that fit our ACE2 receptors (the key molecules, not the receptors, angiotensin, I think it's called) and inadvertently, this creates some cascade which leads to a cycle of really high blood pressure/ immune system inflammation?  Are the coronavirus spikes different enough from our innate enzymes that this risk is really low?


Edit: I added the bit in parentheses, as some ppl thought that I was talking about the receptors themselves, my bad.


Another edit: This is partially coming from a place of already having an autoimmune disorder, I've seen my own body attack cells it isn't supposed to attack.  With the talk of expedited trials, I can't help but be a little worried about outcomes that aren't immediately obvious.
