But I have tried the pill, although I started using it later than many women. I first got the combined pill when I was 26, because that's when I became sexually active. The pill was called Jeanine and I don't remember having any side effects, but a lot was happening in my life so I might not have paid attention. A year later I moved to the UK, and I told my GP the name of the pill I had been on, assuming that he would either prescribe the same or the most similar pill. I got Microgynon that soon gave me painful breasts, weight gain and mood swings. The side effects were so bad, I decided to take a break, and felt so much better, that I never wanted to use any hormones again. Also years later I realised the GP never told me that Microgynon contained an older than Jeanine generation of progestogen. The progestogen in Microgynon is now PROVEN to increase the risk of breast cancer. Fast forward two decades, my periods became heavier and more frequent, and I started suffering from anemia. I have also been diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. My GP recommended the desogestrel POP. I was hesitant, but decided to give it a try. Unfortunately it soon gave me awful mood swings. Not normal mood fluctuations, but weird sudden changes. I was feeling good most of the time, better than without the pill, but for the smallest reasons I would get a sudden mood drop, so bad, that I felt violently suicidal. I'm almost 45, I know myself, I've been through good and bad times, including a tragedy in my family, including grief, and I have never experienced anything like I did on desogestrel. So I stopped using it. I also started reading a lot about hormones, and discovered that the pill does not regulate anything, but switches off your own hormones to replace them with artificial substitutes, that are similar to hormones but don't do everything that hormones do. Nobody knows what the long term consequences of living without your natural hormones are. The pill's safety is largely based on the fact that it's ""well tolerated"" by most users. But is it? I now rely on private hormone tests and herbal treatment for regulation of hormones.",0,,

Whether it be the risks of getting a coil fitted or messing with your hormones with pills/injections/implants etc there's really no winning unless you go for condoms, yet I feel like its an expectation from society that if your in a long term relationship, you go on a contraceptive because a condom takes away from the experience, especially for the man in your life. And when we're in it for the long haul, it's because we love our man, so we take the contraceptive. Do you see where I'm going with this? WHY is there no contraceptive for MEN? I've been frustrated for a long time that the responsibility ultimately falls to me to pick a less than ideal solution for us to have sex without consequences, because it is an expectation from society that pregnancy is a woman's responsibility, and thats on top of dealing with pms and periods every month. Don't get me wrong, I love my man, but how great would it be if we could rotate taking turns on a contraceptive? You can take a turn shoving a coil up your doo-dad or taking pills that make you feel foggy and tired and I can enjoy just being in my own skin without the hormone fog or the stress of getting a coil replaced...

Then came the searing pain that left me clenched in agony whenever it struck, followed by discharge and nausea that didn’t go for weeks. Yet, after undergoing a swab test I was told I didn’t have an infection. After this subsided, I was overjoyed - my periods had lightened and were so infrequent that I barely ever noticed them. This didn’t last. Eventually the period pain became so intense that it left me struggling to string sentences together when it hit and the bleeding was so heavy that I resigned myself to my black granny pants.

The smell and taste was horrendous. And my cervix dropped very low. Like, to the top knuckle of your finger low. Made sex impossible. Had that removed. I had a break for a while whilst I was single and felt amazing. Met a new partner and tried the patch. Incredibly low mood and severe acne again. Then tried the vaginal ring.

Fertility Awareness Method + Condoms works nicely for me now - FAM is 99% effective according to the NHS and yet most women don't even know it exists, or how it works. Hormones are not your only option. If a guy doesn't want to wrap it up then he is not mature or bright enough to be having sex, he should go back to school. Multiple sizes of condoms are on the market now, so 'it's uncomfortable/doesn't fit' is no longer an excuse - measure yourself and get the right size. Women should not have to be put through torturous medications that massively increase our cancer, depression and suicide risk all because some wanker wants to nut in us. I find it absolutely appalling that this documentary seems to demonise contraceptives, followed by telling women they shouldn't use FAM, which is 99% effective according to our own damn health service and works absolutely right when you use it PROPERLY. You have to track your cycles daily for months before you can use it, you need to pick an exact method and stick to it, take temp at the same time every day, etc. It takes work but if you're not putting in the work then you're not doing it.

It seemed like it was what everyone else was doing so I thought it would probably be right for me. It really impacted my mental health but unfortunately I didn't even have the language to describe depression or anxiety at the time let alone think about wether it was affecting me. I came off the pill 2 years later when we split up and it was like a cloud lifted for me. I have tried it on an off a couple of times since and every time without fail (even if I use different pills) it makes my mental health awful. When I asked doctors about this they completely dismissed it so I had to just make the decision to come off it without consulting a medical professional. Because the pill had been so difficult for me I had a copper coil fitted as I wanted a solution that was hormone free. I had heard horror stories from friends about the pain getting it inserted so I did my research and was told to take paracetamol before my appointment. Even with this pain relief (I wasn't offered anything like in this documentary) the insertion was very painful and made me scared to have it removed. Immediately after insertion for around a week I was cramping and bleeding. I was told that the coil normally takes a month to settle however mine never did and I experienced a dull ache in my uterus constantly. When my period came the pain was so excruciating I would pass out. I couldn't even have sex (which is the whole point of having contraception) because it was consistently painful. I told medical professionals about this several times and I kept being told to wait and see if it settled - this was even suggested at an appointment I had a year after having it fitted. I kept having to advocate for myself and all anyone would offer me was pain relief for my painful periods that I didn't have before having the coil fitted. My body felt completely out of my control and I would cry all of the time because of the pain I was being forced to experience due to doctors and nurses not believing me that it was ""bad enough"" to warrant their time. I asked to have an ultrasound several times to check the coil was in the correct position and was dismissed consistently. I was finally admitted for this after I cried to a nurse at a walk in clinic that I had already visited 3 different times to try and get the problem resolved. Finally 2 months later I had my ultrasound and they found nothing wrong. I was absolutely adamant that I needed to have the coil removed after hearing that this was ""supposed"" to be how it felt because I couldn't live my life in pain anymore. I had my routine smear test and tried to speak to the nurse briefly about having my coil removed in my appointment. She informed me that she wouldn't remove the coil I had unless I wanted to get pregnant. When I said that I did not want to get pregnant she said she wouldn't book me in for an appointment to get the coil removed and that I would probably want children soon so I should just wait to have it removed then (I don't and it was none of her business). I was absolutely appalled at this appointment and felt so angry that a foreign object that sterilised and hurt me was being kept in my body without my consent unless I met the specific non medically based opinions of a nurse. Then the pandemic hit so I had another year with this coil in. I eventually was able to book an appointment with a different nurse to get the coil removed. I was really nervous the day I was getting it out and I expected to be in so much pain. The nurse was really kind and talked me through the whole process. After she had put the speculum in I didn't even feel it being taken out. She said it was done and I felt instant relief. About a day later the dull ache finally went away after years of me being in pain. I knew it was wrong from the beginning and I should have been taken seriously and had it taken out immediately. My periods are sill much much heavier than before I ever had the coil and knowing that I will have to live with that for the rest of my life when it could have so easily been avoided makes me feel so sad and angry every month. I understand why documentaries like this promote the coil because its the exact same reasons I had it put in but I really think people who have had coils fitted are not taken seriously when they talk about their pain. Having a uterus does not mean we should experience pain and have out bodily autonomy taken away from us. We all deserve better.",0,,

When young women are consistently failed and ignored, given medication which has an negative affect on their lives but are simultaneously denied... is it any wonder trust in medical professionals is eroded? Men generally can't be trusted to take any male hormone contraceptives as they typically don't like the minor side-effects and they don't become pregnant when they aren't taken properly. I don't know if there will ever be a push for men to take it if it became available - I don't think they'd bother to and the Big Pharma wouldn't make a profit, which is what much of the attraction for bringing it on the market would be.

They should have also delved into the fact that contraceptives are NOT a real treatment for gynecological issues, and it is just a lazy and uninformed way if a GP tries to fob you off with it instead of sending you to a gynecologist to examine what is actually wrong. The pill can have horrible side effects for completely healthy people, and at best it will mask real medical issues, and at worst make them even worse. Access to contraception should be easy, but making condoms more normalized for younger people and leaving medicinal contraception to gynecologists would be so much safer for everyone.

The terrible pain started when I was 15 so I went to the doctor and I was told that the pain is normal, I wasn’t able to swallow tablets so doctor recommended the patch to me. I was told that I need to take the 7 day break with it also. I was on the patch from age 15 to age 24. It gave me terrible anxiety- I struggled with anxiety for years starting around age 16 and thought it was unrelated but after coming off the patch the anxiety just went away! It caused a small bit of weight gain but it was consistent (I was the same weight for all the years I was on it and I am nearly one stone lighter now about 2 years after coming off). I had pins and needles and cramps in my legs a lot and found out (through 23andme) I already have a genetic marker for thrombosis so definitely worried me about the risk for blood clot. Then towards the last 2 years of being on the patch I started to have irregular bleeding at random times of the month when on the patch. This was the reason I came off it because I was sick of randomly bleeding at irregular times. Then after coming off I realised that my moods had been stunted whilst on the patch. I now experience all the highs and lows of my cycle instead of the muted and dull in comparison emotions I had been experiencing before. After coming off, the terrible pain is back! The one that started when I was 15! Still not solved - was only being masked by the patch all this time. 2 years after coming off the patch currently exploring diagnosis and I can now swallow painkillers and I need at least 400mg of ibuprofen to feel relatively ok on cramp days. My periods are now irregular and can last up to 12 days - mainly light or even spotting until I get the pain on day 7/8. My recent blood tests show my Dhea levels are low.

Putting it in was excruciating, and I would have cramps akin to birth contractions around the time of my ovulation every month that would gradually get better each month. But they were genuinely one of the most painful experiences ever. Not saying this to frighten anyone as I have friends who are on it and haven’t experienced these side effects (although they’ve had others), but it’s important to discuss these things :) What was most scary was that at no point was I told about these side effects so I was frightened by the pain, and it was left to me to figure out (by tracking my ovulation etc).",0,,
