For this reason, Luis Miramontes is considered by Lilia Miramontes to be its inventor.[1] Carl Djerassi, Luis Miramontes and George Rosenkranz of the Mexican chemical company Syntex are listed on the patent for norethisterone as its co-inventors. Djerassi ""is now known sometimes as the 'Father of the Pill'"".[2] The historians, nevertheless, agree that the invention, or the first synthesis, is the work of Miramontes.[3][4] For example, the Nobel laureate Max Perutz[5] states that ""On October 15th, 1951, the chemistry student Luis Miramontes, working under the direction of Djerassi and the director of the laboratory Jorge Rosenkranz synthesized the compound"". Djerassi himself affirms that it was, in fact, Miramontes who conducted the last step of the first synthesis of the compound: ""On 15 October 1951, Luis Miramontes, a young Mexican chemist doing his undergraduate bachelor's thesis work at Syntex completed the synthesis of the 19-nor-17α-ethynyltestosterone or, for short 'norethisterone'—which turned out to be the first oral contraceptive to be synthesized.""

I don't really want an answer, then we'd have to start researching and compiling evidence for both men and women if we really are going to figure out which gender experiences more pain in their lifetime. I personally think that it all equals out in the end. But if you have some compelling evidence that I don't already know about (cases of r@pe, abuse, menstruation, pregnancy, birth, physical and emotional damage) then I'll gladly lend an ear. But alas, what point would we be trying to prove? What would we be changing in the end? What fight is not already being fought for both men, women, trans, and whoever else there may be? Or are we simply trying to fuel each other's resentment for each other in the name of our own views, beliefs, and opinions. Women feel pain, Men feel pain, humans feel pain. I don't believe the greatness of said pain is something to use against each other to disavow each other's pain and make them feel like their pain is meaningless and unimportant compared to someone else's. It's just not right. We, as human beings, need to accept that everyone, no matter how big or small, no matter how rich or poor, no matter how guilty or innocent someone may be.

And why the spike in the population started after the post 1960s. What we already know is that autism and adhd occur when the 16th and 17th chromsonal pairs are deformed due to a lack of protein aka autism. Or too much aka adhd. The 16th and 17th pairs control all cognitive functions of the brain, and if its a lack of protein being produced in the womb, its not too far fetched to say that by tricking the woman's womb and hormones into thinking its already pregnant, when the time comes for her to have an actual child it can not receive enough of the proper protein amount it needs in its chromsonal sets due to her womb already releasing her material from the effects of the birth control pill. Since all the pill does is trick the womb's functions into thinking its already pregnant via hormones.",0,,

I do get the point where you probably come from, you’re thinking from the point of view that men don’t want to have children so they should do what is necessary to not have the children by putting themselves through the hardship of doing so instead of putting women through it since they’re primarily the ones who don’t want to have children.

Birth control and condoms are not 100% guaranteed methods at preventing pregnancy. They still should be used, but its not a matter of people being too “lazy” to use them. You are correct that taking birth control is simple, as long as the patient takes it at the same time every day, however, its not taking the pill that is the issue. Many women including myself have had horrible side effects and health complications from the birth control medications and methods that are now available. Yet women still take them because we are the only ones who truly care about preventing pregnancy. Men who want children in the future should not get vasectomies, I never said or intended to suggest that all men should get sterilized. I’m referring to the many, many men that are adamant about not wanting children yet they refuse to do anything to help prevent that from happening. I have not met a single man who has not immediately put the task of preventing pregnancy solely on the woman they are with. Most men hate how condoms feel and don’t want to get a vasectomy because they are uninformed about what it actually is and how little they would be impacted by it. Men’s bodies are at an advantage in comparison with women’s when it comes to this topic, men's sterilization has almost no change on their bodies in terms of the enjoyment of sex and not many consequences. The equivalent sterilization surgery for women would be a tubal ligation, which is not 100% guaranteed either, as women have gotten pregnant with this method. There are also hysterectomies but are more harmful and dangerous on women’s health than a vasectomy for men is. Both of these surgeries also are much more inaccessible than vasectomies because they cost a great deal more, more doctors do not want to perform them, and they will affect the health of the woman very drastically. It takes two people for an unwanted pregnancy to happen, so why do women have to carry all the weight of preventing it? I want to live in a world where men care about preventing pregnancy just as much as women do, that’s what was intended with my comment. But ah yes, I am a horrible, inconsiderate, stupid human being for suggesting that men do something for their female partners that would hurt their bodies less.

Vitamin C increases side effects so careful with lemon juice and grapefruit or even tablets. If shes on combination pill she has up to 12 hours that she can take it late and if shes on mini pill she only has three hours that she can take it late ...anything after that there is risk. An example would be if she takes her pills at 7pm everyday and she forgets it at home and can't take it at 7pm then she has up to 7am to take it , if she's on mini pill and she takes it at 7pm then she only has up to 10pm only 3 hours anything after that there Is risk of pregnancy. Remind her that when she bleed there is no period and it's not called a period it's called breakthrough bleeding or withdrawal you dont get periods on bc also placebo pills dont have to be taken and are only there for 2 reasons one of them is just so you can keep the habit going and some of them contain iron that can help with side effects but dont have to be taken.",1,955dd6719413faa190f056200645443be351d2af,6b0e6baa92f95269c96898f67530efb09cb67dde

Then I changed my gynecologist because I moved to another city and he told me that i don't have PCOS at all, but that I just have hormonal disorder and that I don't have enough one of these hormones so I'm taking pills to reduce my period, but even I'm taking them, i get a period but it's not painful nor I'm bleeding too much, actually I bleed just a little. And sometimes I wish that I'm like other girls, i wouldn't mind painful periods... but worst thing of all of that is that doctor told me that I'll surely have problems to stay pregnant but it's not impossible. But all of this had a huge mental and emotional impact on me and I'm so desperate and depressive. I'm still virgin and never had a boyfriend because all these health problems had negative impact on me, and i was always like how I'm going to say to my future bf ""hey I have a disorder and maybe I'll never have a chance to become a mum one day and give a birth to our child"".

There are MANY negatives to taking the pill, it is sad that Drs prescribe it to so many young girls whos cycles have barely had the chance to settle in. When I first started my period I was in so much pain/agony and had heavy bleeding for years, no pain relief worked.

By that logic a man ejaculation sperm is the equivalent of abortion. I also like to point out that a fertilized egg (notice the term fertilized) can be washed away if it fails to attach before the menstruation cycle begins. If God (or your general belief that egg=human) really consider a fertilized egg as baby then he would of made some way to protect the fertilized egg despite the menstruation process. Once again people are trying to find away to control women's bodies. Y'all completely ignore a man's reproductive organs and only focus on the female, and it's getting old and retarded.
