description,"The birth control pill changes women's brains. Because of this, it changes women and often in surprising ways. This talk will teach listeners about what science knows about the pill and the brain, empowering women to make informed health choices. Sarah Hill is a research psychologist who studies women, psychology, and health using the theoretical tools made available from the evolutionary sciences. She has published dozens of papers on topics like eating, sexual behavior, inflammation, and romantic relationships. Recently, she has turned her expertise to uncovering what we know and don’t know about the impact of the birth control pill on the brain. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx"
