First of all I need to say that I am not stating that what is said in this video is not generally true. I am not scientist or even medical expert. I just want to share my experience with birth control pill which is opposite of everything which is stated in this video, and yes, it could be that I am a huge exception, but I think that is also good to be heard. I have taken ""Mercilon"" from when I was 16 till 36 years old. So - a lot! I didn't have any weight gain, or any acne (my skin was so clean), didn't have any health or blood problems. Only what I discovered is that it is better to take them at evening, because if I was taking them at morning my eyes had higher sensitivity to light. Also, when I stopped with them - I gave my body two years time to see am I any different - and I was not any different in comparison when I was taking pills. Than I decided to become pregnant, and first month when I tried with my husband - I become pregnant. So I know that some of my female friends had problems with pills, I am not stating that they are safe for all at all, I am just saying that in my case they were life saver. I was always attracted to mans with beards and mustaches (which I see as quite masculine thing) and stronger jaw, and my libido was always crazy high. During my lifetime I had a lot of female friends which was shaming me because I am taking pills, and overall there is so much stigma around that theme at least in my country. So I am loudly saying that I am so grateful for birth pills in my life, only thing that they make for me is that I had a more carefree life, more pleasure, and easier planned parenthood.",0,,

Broadly speaking, everything she says here can be applied to any and all hormonal birth control. And yes, the patch IS hormonal. So are hormonal IUDs. The difference is what type of hormone (progesterone-only, or a combination of progesterone and estrogen) and in what dosage. Again, broadly speaking, the most “mild” form would be a low-dose of progesterone-only. (Although I don’t know if they make the patch P-Only). A high-dose combination version will be the one with the MOST pronounced effects. The patch tends to have a lower dose… but double check this.

However, hormonal birth control should be taken with caution, as there are some of us who are very sensitive to hormonal imbalances which can cause major, unwanted side effects including depression, blood clots, and trigger early onset hair loss. I hope everyone can find a doctor who will do a careful assessment of their patient to minimise the risk rather than applying a one size fits all approach.",0,,

The body can take up to several months to return to a normal menstrual cycle after stopping the pill. Common side effects of your body readjusting can be benign cysts on the ovaries (they will go away once everything has settles) It can also be known to cause thinning of the hair, slower wound healing and temporary hormonal fluctuations in mood/libido. Stopping the pill can also cause several months of heavier and more painful/heavy periods. I stopped the pill a couple of years ago for 3 months, I was in pain, I developed a benign cyst (I’ve never had these before) and my periods were a bit abnormal. I visited the gyno and she said “the pill puts your ovaries to sleep..” so I went back on it. I now understand that doctors are encouraged to push the contraceptive pill, despite the heavily researched, horrid and common side effects. I did not know at the time that all these symptoms were most likely very temporary, and these were actually a normal withdrawal-like reaction my body was having. My body had to learn to have a proper menstrual period again, and the ability to ovulate. The effects these hormones have on a woman’s body is astounding, and very scary to say the least. Please do more research, my skin has cleared almost 50%, my excessive head/upper body sweating has stopped, I’m slowly returning to a normal weight range, my bipolar disorder has finally become completely manageable, I can sleep properly, I don’t crave unhealthy food, no more night sweats, I have hardly any inflammation and water retention anymore.

I’ve been tested for so many things but I’m still working with doctors to figure out what is going on. Thyroid is normal, no celiac disease, no cushings, and my blood work seems normal. I strongly believe that I wouldn’t be dealing with this if I didn’t sabotage my body by being on the pill for 10 years. It has been heartbreaking to deal with this with no end in sight.

For people who have cystic acne, leaving it be can cause scarring, pain and long-term psychological trauma. By the same measure, lifestyle changes doesn't do the trick for everyone. Even if it does, it doesn't mean all people are capable of lifestyle change. You could go hoarse telling people to stop smoking, lose weight, exercise everyday - will there? No. That's why we have alternatives. Prescription medications can be great for mild acne. For example, antibiotics and retinols. But how about accutane? The side effects are very severe.

I’ve always had strong emotions as well, especially on the stimulatory side - anxiety, ‘-agitated’ depression (depression that isn’t numb but actively troubling and tormenting). Since going on the pill beginning of this year, I’ve noticed all my emotions have become dulled: esp anxiety. It’s lowered my anxiety sooo much but unfortunately increased my depression, anger and somehow contributed to extreme low self-esteem if that makes sense. Although admittedly I had some rather weird experiences in the last few years which are definitely on my mind all the time, but I can’t help but notice the effects of the pill as well. Unfortunately I have to take it for extreme pain otherwise during menstruation, and I have a sensitivity to NSAIDs. Even with “stomach protection medicines” (proton pump inhibitors, antacid medication) I still get extreme stomach pain with NSAIDs, hence my decision to go on the pill. It’s excruciating living this way and I don’t know what to do anymore.

He doesn't have a memory disorder. 2. I tried leaving him compassionately. His response: Emotional manipulation through having a fake panic attack, crying, sobbing, lying that he will quit ignoring me and giving me the silent treatment, and begging to stay with me. My response: Feeling guilt tripped, which it was my responsibility to leave, I came back a few days later doubting myself. This is also due to me being on birth control and having depression which makes you doubt yourself a lot. He used that against me to selfishly lure me in. 3. He was very self absorbed. I tried pointing this out, which I did bluntly so probably not the best approach, but his response. Oh lord. His response: Again, full blown fake panic attack. He shut me out again. He didn't listen but lied and said ""I know"", which was basically his catch phrase. My response: Anger. Rage. Yelling. I feel such guilt for this but I understand I wasn't the problem. My response was. Hopefully some of you have learned from his behaviors and to either fix them in yourselves and/or avoid others who do these things.

Basically it is altered by chemists to bind with progesterone receptors that make the body act as if it is progesterone, but because this synthesized hormone is ( to use her description ) messy, greater amounts of it than would naturally be produced by women at that point in their cycle have to be used since it doesn't bond like the real stuff. But it also binds to the receptors of other hormones. They don't actually know all the consequences to this, but one is the hormone also binds with glucocorticoid receptors which makes the body feel in a constant state of stress which shuts down the cortisol stress response which mimics PTSD.
